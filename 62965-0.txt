                                Preface


In a recent interview at her villa in the Riviera, the ex-Empress
Eugénie is reported to have said: “I have lived; I have been; I do not
ask more. I ask not to be remembered. Between my past and my present
there exists not half a century, but ten centuries. Men have changed,
times have changed. It is a dream that is dissipated.” It is a
fascinating story, as told in these pages, the career of this
granddaughter of a Scotch wine-merchant, who by the power of her
personal charm, the incentive of her ambition, and the boldness of her
resolution, achieved her purpose, though stigmatized an upstart and
adventuress, and eventually driven from the throne and doomed to spend
her remaining days brooding over the loss of her power and her beauty;
over France’s crushing defeat in what the short-sighted Empress lightly
termed “my war”; over her folly in urging Napoleon into the war;
sorrowing over his death, and chiefly, lamenting the death of her son at
the hands of Zulu savages in that far-away land whither she had urged
him to go. Hers is an adventurous, a romantic, in every way an
extraordinary, life-story. It shows what one of determined will and
fixed purpose may do. But was it worth the doing? In these days, looking
back over her career, all she can say is: “I am the past. I am the
distant horizon where exists a mirage, a shadow, a phantom, a living
sorrow. I am an old woman, poor in everything that makes a woman rich.
My husband, my son—that brave boy—they are gone. My eyes no longer turn
to the future. I live only in my youth. There is nothing for me but to
wait. My dreary winter is nearly over.” Poor Eugénie! That she still
clings to the hope of seeing a descendant of Napoleon on the throne of
France is evidenced by a letter to an old soldier who recently appealed
to her for help, in which she says: “As her majesty admits that every
old soldier of the empire has remained faithful to the sacred cause, to
the imperial eagles, it is necessary so that her majesty may be assured
of a devotion of which she—or rather the legitimate heir to the
throne—will perhaps have need sooner than one thinks, that she receives
from you a letter in which she will find the expression of your
unshakable devotion to the memory of Napoleon III and to the Imperial
cause, as well as the expression of your mistrust of the present
regime.”

                               Chapter I
                          The Youth of Eugénie


At the beginning of the last century there dwelt in the city of Malaga
in Spain a merchant named Kirkpatrick. Although descended from a Scotch
family of distinction that had been forced by the fall of the Stuarts to
flee their native land, this later scion of the race earned his
livelihood by the sale of wines which he dispensed with his own hand in
a room at the rear of his shop. The business prospered and he became a
rich man, exporting large quantities of Spanish wines to foreign
countries; but he still kept his wine-room in Malaga, assisted by his
four daughters, who did much to attract custom.

The lofty family traditions of the Kirkpatricks of Closeburn could
scarcely have been expected to be remembered amid the practical duties
of the merchant’s busy life, but his beautiful daughters were by no
means unaware of their high descent nor without hope of elevating
themselves once more to the rank of their ancestors. Of the four
sisters, Manuela, the third, was the most aspiring as well as the most
beautiful. Even when busy serving wine and chatting gayly with the
gentlemen who frequented her father’s wine-room, her mind was constantly
dwelling on the traditions of her house, and in the glories of the past
she forgot the sordid surroundings of the present. Although a true
daughter of the soil from which she sprang, Manuela was very different
from the ordinary Spanish girl, who is often indolent and ignorant; for
with her Scotch blood she inherited the energy without which her dreams
and ambitions could never have been realized. Determined to rise in the
world, and with nothing but herself and her beauty to depend upon, she
decided that only a brilliant marriage could accomplish her ends; and to
achieve this she was ready to use any means or make any sacrifice.

Among the officers stationed at that time in Malaga, most of whom were
frequent patrons of Kirkpatrick’s wine-room, was a colonel of artillery
in the Spanish army, Count Manuel Fernandez de Teba. No longer young,
and far from attractive in person, having lost an eye, and being very
short-sighted besides, he was little fitted to awaken tender sentiments
in the fair sex; but Manuela was not to be daunted by this. His heart
seemed a citadel not too difficult of conquest, and without regard to
his appearance she devoted herself to the study of his antecedents. The
result of these genealogical researches exceeded her fondest hopes, for
they proved that the bluest blood of Spain flowed in Count Teba’s veins.
He was descended from the noble Genoese family of Porto-Carrero, which,
emigrating to Estremadura in the fourteenth century, had secured by
marriage the right to bear some of the most illustrious names of Spain
as well as the heirship to the joint estates of Teba, Banos, and Mora.
He was the second son, it is true, but his elder brother was unmarried;
and if she united her future with his, the ambitious maiden could reckon
with some security on attaining in time the rank and position to which
she aspired.

Her father’s increasing prosperity, no less than her own remarkable
beauty, caused many younger and handsomer suitors to lay their homage at
Manuela’s feet, but however favored any one of these may have believed
himself, he was now cast remorselessly aside. Her course once decided
on, she lost not a moment in setting her hand to the work. She showed
Count Teba the most delicate attentions, the most flattering deference;
for him were reserved her sweetest smiles, her tenderest glances, until
at last the credulous nobleman’s admiration kindled into passion, and
without even consulting his family, Manuel Fernandez, afterwards Count
de Montijo and Duke de Peneranda, married Maria Manuela, daughter of the
wine-merchant Kirkpatrick. The young Countess at once set up an
establishment on the grandest scale. Her salons became the resort of the
richest and most distinguished officers, and she charmed every one with
her hospitality, her beauty, and her wit.

While she was enjoying her triumph to the full, however, evil tongues
were soon busy over the free and easy tone said to prevail in the home
of the worthy pair—a rumor that quickly found its way to the Count de
Montijo. From the first he had strongly disapproved of his brother’s
unsuitable marriage, and, indignant at the gossip caused by his
sister-in-law’s behavior, he determined to prevent their becoming his
heirs, by making a marriage himself in his old age. Manuela was seized
with fury at this news; but prudence soon gained the upper hand, and
instead of sulkily avoiding her new relatives she made every effort to
win their approval, a course that was the less difficult for her to
pursue, as, to her secret joy, the marriage remained childless. Tired of
living in her native place where she was constantly reminded of her
humble origin, she finally persuaded her husband to leave Malaga; and
with their little daughter Francisca Theresa they moved to Granada,
where the Count’s brother had his residence. There, on the fifth of May,
1826, the future Empress of the French, Maria Eugénie, was born—the same
day of the same month on which Napoleon the Great had died.

Eugénie’s mother was a perfect woman of the world. Brilliant and clever
and mistress of the art of conversation, she far surpassed the ordinary
Spanish woman in intellect as well as wit. It was not strange,
therefore, that with all these charms at her command she had succeeded
in winning over her brother-in-law and sister-in-law, and establishing
herself in their favor; so that Count Teba’s family soon became welcome
guests at all the Montijo entertainments, where they were received with
the utmost courtesy and respect. But even this did not satisfy Manuela.
She longed for a life of more freedom and unrestraint, and to climb yet
higher in the ranks of society. Her ambition was destined to be
fulfilled, for before many years had passed Count Teba stood beside the
bier of his childless brother; and his wife now persuaded him to take up
his residence in Madrid.

The domestic life of Eugénie’s parents had never been a harmonious one.
Her mother’s extravagance and coquetry, together with the jealous and
violent temper of her father, soon banished the genius of peace from the
household; and their quarrels were the more frequent and bitter from the
Countess’s lack of any real affection for her husband. Matters grew even
worse after their arrival in the capital, for Manuela gave herself up
entirely to intrigues and made her husband’s life miserable. Here, too,
she was prompted less by passion than by ambition, since it was through
her connection with influential persons that she hoped to obtain a
position at court. Among the many she attracted to her house was General
Narvaez, at that time the most powerful man in Spain. At his
intercession, the wine-merchant’s daughter was made first
lady-in-waiting to the youthful Queen Isabella. This coveted post she
could no doubt have easily retained had she not allowed her passions for
once to gain the upper hand. A young Italian for whom she had a fondness
disappeared one fine day with all her jewels; and on this occasion she
so far overstepped the bounds permissible even at the Spanish court that
it was intimated to her she would do well to leave Madrid.

While their mother was thus coquetting and intriguing at court, Eugénie
and her sister, two years older than herself, had been left at the
Sacred Heart Convent in Paris. The Countess now took the two girls away
with her, and, leaving her husband in Madrid, began a pleasant life of
travel, dividing her time between London, Paris, and the fashionable
watering-places, everywhere gathering about her a circle of friends and
adorers, many of them men distinguished in the world of art and
learning,—although the greater part of her admirers belonged to that
class which lives in enjoyment of the present, preferring the pleasures
of the senses to those of the mind. Over her young daughters’
acquaintances and associates, however, she kept a close watch; whatever
her own indiscretions may have been during this period, she carefully
guarded their innocence from all evil influences. She neglected no
opportunities for improving their minds, and it was then that the
foundations were laid of that excellent education which no one ever
ventured to deny the Empress Eugénie.

It was impossible for the careful mother not to perceive the attention
excited wherever they went by her younger daughter’s beauty, her regular
features, exquisite coloring, large clear eyes, and wonderful golden
hair; and while she little dreamed that Eugénie was destined to become
the sovereign of a great European nation, with justifiable maternal
pride she began to hope that her child might rise to even greater rank
than she herself had attained. To pave the way to this good fortune, the
Countess Montijo made another attempt to regain her position at court,
but met with a prompt refusal. Narvaez, however, who was still in power,
took her under his protection without more ado; and on the death of her
husband, in 1839, she determined to return to Madrid, where, at the
expiration of her period of mourning, the handsome widow accordingly
appeared, accompanied by her still more lovely daughters, Francisca, at
that time seventeen years old, and Eugénie, fifteen. The sisters were a
complete contrast to each other though equally beautiful. The elder was
darker and more slender, and her features were softer than Eugénie’s,
though her face had less character.

Through the zeal and influence of Narvaez and their mother’s prudence
and perseverance, the Queen was finally induced to take the young girls
into her court, but their position there was by no means an enviable
one. As daughters of a woman who in spite of her personal attractions
was well known to have led an irregular life, they were looked upon with
general suspicion; and as they constantly appeared with this mother in
society, it was only natural that members of their own sex should hold
aloof from them, while the men redoubled their attentions in
consequence. The Countess Montijo was shrewd enough to see that she must
proceed with caution if she wished her plans realized; therefore, to
protect her daughters from the reefs on which her own reputation had
been wrecked, she kept all undesirable cavaliers at a respectful
distance. Among all those who sought the young Countesses’ favor there
was only one she considered worthy to occupy the position of her
son-in-law, the Duke of Berwick and Alva; him she encouraged in every
way, permitting him to ride and drive with her daughters and accompany
them to the theatre, giving him an intimate footing in the family. His
companionship was a source of delight to both sisters, and he soon
became the centre of their thoughts, possessing as he did the art of
making himself so agreeable to both that each one fancied herself the
object of his preference.

Eugénie adored Alva with all the intensity of a first love, endowing him
with all the loftiest and most noble qualities; and, worshipping this
image created by her fancy, believed herself loved in return. The
mother, however, more experienced in the faithlessness of man, began to
suspect that he had no intention of choosing either daughter as a
companion for life; accordingly she set before him, when he came one day
to call, the serious alternative of declaring himself or severing all
intercourse with the family; to which ultimatum the Duke replied by
requesting the hand of the elder. When Francisca, radiant with joy,
hastened to her sister’s room to announce the great news she found her
in bed. At first she thought her asleep, but on coming closer discovered
to her horror that Eugénie’s eyes were fixed and staring, her forehead
covered with beads of moisture, her features drawn and convulsed—she had
taken poison! Francisca’s screams of distress quickly brought her mother
and the maid to the scene. A physician was summoned, and Eugénie was
restored to consciousness. A long and serious illness followed. In her
delirious ravings she betrayed the fact that, hidden behind a door, she
had overheard the Duke’s avowal and in despair had tried to end her
life. Her recovery was slow and tedious. Even after she had been
pronounced out of danger, her nervous system showed traces of the shock
in a slight trembling, a nervous quiver of the eyelids, that never
entirely left her. The sudden attacks of depression, the fits of weeping
that sometimes seized her in after years, even in the midst of some
festivity, may also be ascribed to the effects of the poison taken in
her youth.

Still deeper were the traces left on the young girl’s character by this
unhappy experience. Though taught by pride to conquer her love for the
husband of her sister, she was forced to be a daily witness of that
sister’s happiness and to endure the pity with which she was universally
regarded, added to which was the galling conviction that the Duke
himself suspected her secret. The once shy and modest maiden became a
bold, forward coquette, striving to forget her sufferings in a whirl of
pleasure and amusement, craving admiration, ambitious and frivolous. As
a child she had always preferred boys’ sports to the usual occupations
of girls, and excelled in riding, swimming, and fencing. Now she might
be seen any afternoon galloping bareback through the streets of Madrid,
smoking a cigar or a cigarette. She devised all sorts of fanciful
costumes that only she could wear, often appearing in the Andalusian
national dress. She was a frequent visitor at the theatre and all public
places of amusement, and had a passion for bull-fights. One of the
toreadors, for whom she embroidered a splendid cloak, was her declared
lover. She rarely missed one of these gory festivals; and, seated on the
lowest tier among the most enthusiastic spectators, in her Andalusian
costume, she was always the centre of attraction. The womanly modesty
that had made Eugénie so charming in her early girlhood had vanished,
but she was even more beautiful and fascinating. She was surrounded by
admirers, and encouraged the addresses of dukes and princes till her
coquetries aroused the jealousy of the Queen. But no one paid court to
her seriously. Suitors were naturally shy of choosing a wife who often
appeared in masculine attire, who wore the most startling and
conspicuous bathing costumes to excite admiration while in the water,
and whose hand was as familiar with riding-whip and stiletto as with fan
or bouquet.

In spite of her many extravagances, however, Eugénie’s youth was marked
by a gay thoughtlessness and daring that were most attractive. Her
self-reliant nature could brook no restraint. She scorned prudence and
yielded rashly to every impulse. The attention she attracted could not
fail to furnish food for gossip, and malicious tongues were soon busy
with her reputation—a fact which did not deter her in the least from
pursuing her fondness for adventure. This indifference to public opinion
also led her, unfortunately, to defy custom and snap her fingers at the
strict etiquette prescribed at court. At last she went out alone one
evening with one of the young pages for a long walk. Whispers of this
romantic promenade soon reached the ears of Queen Isabella, who, though
setting the worst possible example herself in regard to morals, insisted
on the strictest propriety in the behavior of her ladies; and both
culprits were summarily dismissed from her service.

Like all Spanish girls, Eugénie had been brought up from her earliest
years a devout Catholic, with the deepest reverence for the Pope and the
Roman religion, a devotion that in time became almost fanaticism and
furnished her enemies with a weapon of attack against which she was
powerless to defend herself. After her dismissal from court she began to
reflect on the difference between a religious life and one of idle
pleasure. While at the convent, the contrast between the unselfish
devotion of the nuns and the atmosphere of her parents’ disordered
household made a deep impression on the young girl’s mind, and the
Church seemed a blissful refuge from the storms of life. Now—feeling
more and more conscious of the void within her—a passion for religion
seized her, a longing to escape from the world of lies and slander in
which she lived, into a purer atmosphere, a new field of activity. The
Church held out its arms to her, and in them she determined to seek
relief and to find strength to devote her life to the poor and
suffering. It is said that when Eugénie went to the convent prepared to
take the vows, an old half-witted nun approached, gazed at her with
dull, vacant eyes, and suddenly exclaimed, “My daughter, do not seek
shelter behind our walls. You are destined to adorn a throne!”

In her state of religious ecstasy these words could not fail to impress
Eugénie deeply. It seemed a voice from heaven, speaking to her through
the nun and consecrating her to the world. The Countess Montijo, too,
did all she could to strengthen her daughter in this conviction, and
persuaded her at length, instead of burying herself in a cloister, to
travel abroad with her again.




                               Chapter II
                  Eugénie’s Marriage to Louis Napoleon


As a child, Eugénie was seldom seen without a knot of violets in her
hair or in her belt; and when the scorching summer sun of Spain made
these blossoms scarce, a shepherd boy was commissioned to bring them to
her from the heights of the Sierra Nevada. Even when older, she still
wore her favorite flowers on all occasions, for a gipsy had foretold
that her fortune “would flourish with the violet.” So on that memorable
evening toward the end of the thirties, when at a Spanish watering-place
Napoleon and Eugénie (she, then, almost a child) saw each other for the
first time, she wore a wreath of violets in her hair.

“I shall never forget,” said an eye-witness of the scene, “the way in
which the Prince gazed at the young Countess when she was presented to
him.”

The acquaintance was renewed some years later during a winter residence
in London (1847-48), and it was only natural that these two, brought
together by chance, should be attracted to one another. Both were of
noble rank; both had a longing for fame and splendor; both were
unfaltering in the pursuit of their ambitions; both were rich in hopes,
yet poor in worldly possessions; and though full of courage and faith in
the future, both were in reality adventurers. They were soon on terms of
intimacy, and Louis Napoleon could no doubt have won the hand of Eugénie
at that time. But his future was still uncertain. He was poor and
heavily in debt, with the reputation of leading a dissipated life; and
although she returned his love, she was prudent enough to renounce for
the time being the opportunity of becoming a princess. Convinced that
her lover’s aspiring dreams would be realized, however, and wishing to
have a claim on his gratitude as well as his affections, she wrote him
as follows, on their parting:—

“You want to go to Paris to begin the struggle for power; to become
consul, president, dictator. But suppose these goals are attained, will
you stop there? Will that satisfy your ambition? Without a doubt you
will aim yet higher, and then how troublesome you would find a wife! An
Emperor must keep the place beside him for an Empress. Should your plans
fail, on the other hand, should France not offer what you expect, then
and only then, come back to me and I will give you an answer to your
proposal. Do not forget there is one heart ready to recompense you for
any troubles—for all disappointed hopes.”

On the news of the Revolution of February and Louis Philippe’s flight,
Napoleon hastened to Paris. At the first election for a constitutional
National Assembly (April, 1848) his cause met with little support. Not
until the supplementary election did the Prince’s adherents appear as a
party, but once in the field they spared no pains to win the victory.
Bonapartist proclamations were distributed throughout Paris; and in the
course of eight days no less than six of the principal organs of the
press came out for him openly. Results showed the progress made by the
party even in this short time, for the Prince was chosen representative
of the capital of France; and similar faith was shown in him by three
other Departments. His election aroused long and heated debates in the
National Assembly, and his friends began to fear for his safety if he
remained in Paris. Returning to London, therefore, he sent a letter to
the legislature, stating that in consideration of the hostile attitude
toward him taken by the executive power, he felt it his duty to renounce
an honor it believed him to have won by fraud.

This politic withdrawal, together with the unceasing efforts of his
friends, served to influence public opinion still more in his favor. At
the new election following the June uprising the people of Paris chose
Napoleon for the second time as their representative, and after an exile
of thirty years, he hastened back to the capital to take his place in
the Assembly, from which a few months later (December 20) he was
elevated to the Presidency of the Republic.

About the time of Napoleon’s departure Eugénie and her mother also left
London, spending that summer at Spa and the following winter in
Brussels, surrounded as usual by a swarm of admirers. But all this time,
while the Prince was swiftly and surely approaching the throne of
France, Eugénie’s eyes were firmly fixed on Paris. With eager gaze she
watched the rising of Napoleon’s star, and shortly before the Empire was
proclaimed, the Spanish Countesses appeared in the capital. At last
Louis Napoleon was made Emperor. More than eight million Frenchmen had
voted for the restoration of the dynasty, and on the first of December,
1852, the Senate, the legislative body, and the Council of State paid
him homage at St. Cloud. Although formally assuming the title for the
first time on this occasion, he had in reality ruled as absolute
sovereign since the _Coup d’État_ (December 2-5, 1851). His entry into
Paris as Emperor, amid the thunder of cannon, the pealing of trumpets,
and the shouts of the multitude, was merely the crowning of a work
shrewdly planned and cleverly executed, denounced by his enemies as a
crime and glorified by his friends as a heroic achievement.

The magnificent entertainments given by the Prince-President in the
Élysée Palace, and the yet more splendid ones that followed at the
Tuileries after he became Emperor, had been presided over with tact and
grace by his cousin Mathilde, daughter of the ex-King of Westphalia.
Fifteen or sixteen years before, during a visit which Mathilde de
Montfort had paid to Arenenberg, the residence of Queen Hortense, there
had been some talk of a marriage between her and Louis Napoleon.
Hortense, who loved her niece with all a mother’s tenderness, had looked
forward with joy to a union so suitable in every respect, and it had
been agreed upon in a family council of Bonapartes. But the Prince’s
first premature attempt to secure his uncle’s throne put an end to the
plan, and Mathilde was married, in 1841, to the millionaire Prince of
San Donato, Anatole Demidoff. After a few years of childless and unhappy
marriage they separated, the Princess retiring to a villa near Paris,
whence she was summoned to the capital by her cousin when he became
President. The youthful lovers had each led a stormy life since their
last meeting, and the romantic attachment that had drawn them together
at Arenenberg had long since evaporated. In its place a firm and quiet
friendship had arisen, and for the second time Napoleon thought
seriously of marrying his cousin. It was the dearest wish of all the
Bonapartes; but again fate intervened, this time by the Church’s refusal
to annul the Princess’s marriage with Demidoff. The Prince-President
found himself forced therefore to seek elsewhere for a bride.

He sued in vain for the hand of a Russian Princess, and was refused in
turn by a sister of the King of Spain, and the Portuguese Duchess of
Braganza. However alluring may have been the chance of becoming
sovereign of France, these princesses had little desire to trust their
fate in the hands of an adventurer. Well-meaning friends next drew his
attention to the poor but beautiful Carola de Wasa, a cousin of King
Gustavus the Fourth of Sweden, afterwards Queen of Saxony. An envoy was
sent to negotiate preliminaries, and her family requested time for
consideration; but the Princess, who was most unfavorably impressed with
Napoleon’s portrait, protested with tears against the proposed marriage.
Beside himself at these repeated rebuffs, the Prince swore to win the
daughter of some royal house if forced to do it sword-in-hand, and
continued in his quest. Through his friend Lord Malmesbury, he urged
Queen Victoria to arrange an alliance between himself and her cousin,
Princess Adelaide; and though some objections were raised by the Queen
and Prince Consort, the matter was still under consideration when, on
January 19, 1853, the world was amazed by the following paragraph which
appeared in _La Patrie_, the semi-official organ of Paris, and was
copied without comment in all the other journals:

  “According to reliable report, a happy event, calculated to strengthen
  His Majesty’s Government and ensure the future of his dynasty, is soon
  to take place. It is said that the Emperor is about to be married to
  Mlle. de Montijo de Teba. Official announcement of the approaching
  marriage will be made to the Legislature on Thursday, the
  twenty-second of January. The Countess belongs to one of the noblest
  families of Spain. She is a sister of the Duchess of Alva and is noted
  for her wit and cleverness, as well as her remarkable beauty.”

Needless to say, Eugénie had gone to Paris solely for the purpose of
meeting Napoleon, and after her arrival she had waited patiently for an
opportunity of obtaining access to him. Introduced by Rothschild and his
daughter, and accompanied by the Spanish Prince Camerata, she finally
made her appearance in the court circle for the first time at Compiègne
in 1852. It was at one of the hunts given by the Prince-President; and
the grace and skill with which she managed her fiery Andalusian excited
the admiration of all present. Napoleon himself was completely
fascinated. Their former meetings at once recurred to him with a rush of
youthful memories, and for the rest of the day he scarcely left her
side. Nor did it end here; after the court had returned to Paris the
Countess and her mother were never permitted to miss an entertainment at
the Tuileries or the Élysée.

The flattering attentions paid to Mlle. Montijo by the sovereign could
not remain long unnoticed or unremarked. It was now merely a question of
improving the moment. No opportunity for bringing herself to his notice
or of displaying her charms to the best advantage was neglected, and far
outshining, as she did, all the women of Napoleon’s circle at that time,
Eugénie soon succeeded in arousing his old passion for her. His warm and
ardent devotion was such a contrast to his usual calm self-possession
that the whole court was astonished, although no one dreamed that the
affair would end in marriage. It is doubtful whether the Emperor himself
had any such idea in the beginning, having resolved in his days of
poverty and exile to wed none but a royal princess. He only went so far
as to intimate to Eugénie that he would esteem himself happy in being
her lover.

But she was no longer the innocent girl of sixteen, cherishing a
romantic passion for an Alva and deeming no sacrifice too great for her
love. Genuine as her affection doubtless was for Louis Napoleon, she
would make no sacrifices without gaining something in return. At the
height of his power and fame the man who had brought about a revolution
and made himself sole ruler of France by his shrewdness and resolution
seemed in her eyes the ideal of manly courage and heroism; yet none the
less, the hot-blooded Andalusian showed herself in this case as cold as
ice. Her experience of life had taught her that denial was the surest
means of stimulating a passion. The Emperor was not easily caught,
however. He despatched a confidential friend to the Countess de Montijo,
not to ask for her daughter’s hand, but to make it clear to the shrewd
woman of the world that Eugénie could not count on being Empress.
Reasons of state prevented his placing the crown on the head of his
beloved, although such an event might not be an impossibility should he
be free to follow his desires in the future. But the Countess, like her
daughter, being well aware of the surest means of attaining her end,
made short work of the Emperor’s envoy. Repeated attempts at persuasion
proved equally fruitless, and Eugénie finally sent Napoleon, with her
respectful greetings, the message: “Cæsar’s wife should be above
suspicion.”

                   [Illustration: _EMPRESS EUGÉNIE_]

Goaded on by this reserve, the Emperor could no longer restrain himself,
and the Countess’s persistent refusals furnished him a welcome excuse
for broaching the plan of a marriage with her. It met with violent
opposition from all his relatives and friends, who did all in their
power to dissuade him from it, imploring him to choose, in default of a
royal princess, at least some French lady of rank or lineage known to
the people. To divert him from his purpose a marriage was proposed with
the Polish Princess Czartoryska. But completely absorbed by his passion
for Eugénie their opposition only served to fan the flame, and at last,
to end the painful subject, he asked one of his court ladies, the
Princess Lieven, whether he should choose the Princess Czartoryska or
Mlle. de Montijo. To which she cleverly replied, “If you leave it to me,
Sire, I prefer the Cachucha to the Mazurka”—an answer which Napoleon
accepted as the voice of fate. At the earliest opportunity he sent a
formal request to the Countess Montijo for the hand of her daughter, and
was of course welcomed by both with open arms.

The news of the betrothal excited endless wonder but little
satisfaction. There was almost a panic in the Bourse, that political
barometer, and the Emperor’s intimate friends and family went about with
gloomy faces. The proposed marriage was openly opposed in the
ministerial council and regarded with great disfavor by the general
public; in short, only three persons were really pleased—Eugénie, her
mother, and Napoleon. As for the first, her wildest hopes were at last
to be realized. From doubtful obscurity she was to rise to loftiest
heights. Providence had chosen her for this position and she bowed to
its decree. The week that intervened between the betrothal and the
wedding ceremonies slipped by in an intoxication of happiness. She was
greeted on all sides with respect and adulation, and overwhelmed with
protestations of devotion from the courtiers. The proudest nobles of
France paid homage to her. Her enemies were silent, while Napoleon’s
friends who had been most bitterly opposed to the match now fawned upon
her, greedy for favors from their future Empress.

The civil marriage was celebrated quietly on the twenty-ninth of
January; but the magnificence of the religious ceremony exceeded
anything that had been seen in France since the days of the great
Napoleon. From early morning a double row of troops lined the way from
the Tuileries to Notre Dame. All Paris was on the alert to catch at
least a glimpse of the spectacle. The railroads brought more than two
hundred thousand people into the capital from the provinces, and a
motley throng filled the streets, richly decorated with flags and
banners bearing the names of Napoleon and Eugénie, and gay with the
light _toilettes_ of the ladies, and the gold embroidered uniforms of
the soldiers glittering in the sun. Although midwinter, the sky was
clear and the air mild as spring. About half-past eleven, Eugénie
started from the Élysée for the Tuileries. Her mother was seated beside
her, and opposite them the master of ceremonies, Count Tascher de la
Pagerie. The natural beauty of the bride was enhanced still more by the
magnificent gown she wore, a gift from the city of Liége. It was of
white velvet with an overdress of costly lace woven in a pattern of
violets. A jewelled girdle encircled the waist, and on her head was the
diamond coronet worn by Marie Louise on her wedding day, attached to
which were the lace veil and a wreath of orange blossoms. As the
prospective Empress entered the gates of the Tuileries, Prince Napoleon
and the Princess Mathilde appeared at the foot of the staircase to
receive her, while trumpets sounded and the troops presented arms.

Precisely at noon a salute of a hundred and one guns from the Hôtel des
Invalides proclaimed that Their Majesties were entering their coach. A
huge vestibule had been erected in front of the Cathedral, adorned with
paintings representing the saints and olden kings and queens of France.
The church was brilliantly illuminated with thousands of wax tapers; and
as the imperial pair emerged from the vestibule, the trumpets again
sounded, all the bells of Paris rang out, the organ pealed, and the
whole assembly arose while the Archbishop of Paris advanced and stood
before Their Majesties. At the lower end of the church was a platform
occupied by five hundred musicians, and everywhere a mass of gilding and
floral decoration met the eye. Curtains embroidered with golden bees
covered the great windows. From the galleries fell velvet hangings
bearing the name of the Empress in raised embroidery. In the nave of the
church stood the throne; above it, supported by a huge golden eagle, a
canopy of red velvet bordered with ermine. The transepts, in which the
highest dignitaries of the Empire were seated, were lined with superb
paintings, and from the ceiling hung banners bearing the names of the
principal cities of France. The court officials stationed themselves on
one side, the ministers and deputies on the other, as the imperial pair
took their places under the canopy surrounded by princes, princesses,
ladies, and cavaliers.

About one o’clock the ceremony began. It was performed by the Archbishop
of Paris. The Archbishop of Versailles spread a silver bridal veil over
Their Majesties, who sank on their knees; and at the conclusion of the
ceremony, during the singing of the _Te Deum_, Abbé Legran handed to
them the imperial marriage contract. Shrouded in costly lace and
sparkling with jewels, a glittering coronet upon her head, Eugénie
passed out of the Cathedral, leaning on the arm of the Emperor and
preceded by the archbishops and all the clergy. She had reached the
summit of all her hopes. The world lay at her feet. Yet at this supreme
moment it was less a feeling of gratified ambition that filled her bosom
than one of humility and anxiety at the burden of responsibility laid
upon her shoulders. At the zenith of her fortunes, surrounded by pomp
and splendor, and greeted by the cheers of the populace, she was
suddenly seized with a foreboding of her coming fate. It may have been
owing to her overtaxed nerves or the excitement of these new
experiences, but as she came out of the Cathedral she seemed to see the
features of Marie Antoinette among the crowd. Wherever she looked this
face rose up before her, and with a sinking of the heart she began to
realize that all this coveted splendor might be indeed a heavy burden.




                              Chapter III
                         Eugénie’s Personality


After the wedding a glowing account of the ceremony was published in the
_Moniteur_, which concluded as follows:

  “The interest displayed by the people in their new sovereign was
  prompted by more than idle curiosity. The universal admiration she
  excited was genuine. Those noble features, enhanced by their
  expression of sweetness and modesty, irresistibly attracted the
  working classes, who felt that the Empress regarded them with kindness
  and good-will.”

This assertion was not groundless, for although public opinion, as we
have seen, had been against the Emperor’s choice, and although among the
cheering throngs that greeted the sovereigns there was much secret
dissatisfaction, the spell of Eugénie’s beauty and charm of manner was
so potent that even her enemies were silenced by it. The lovely face
with its regular delicate features suggests in contour the portraits of
Mary Stuart. Her complexion was dazzling and her brown hair full of
golden gleams. Under the heavy lashes and delicately pencilled eyebrows,
her blue eyes, so dark as almost to seem black, were full of fire and
softness, reflecting the tender heart and dauntless soul within. The
Andalusians are famous for the beauty of their hands and feet, and
Eugénie’s did not belie her origin. The lines of her figure and the
curves of her neck were as perfect as those of an antique statue; in
short, hers was a flawless exterior in which no discord marred the
complete harmony of the picture.

Thus elevated to a throne, Eugénie burned with desire to make herself
beloved by the people, to excite the admiration of those about her, and
silence all hints as to her birth and checkered past. Controlling her
naturally impulsive and passionate nature when necessary, concealing her
pride and ambition under a modest, almost humble air, she left nothing
undone to add to her popularity and strengthen her position. Two
qualities invaluable to a sovereign she naturally possessed—magnanimity
and an open hand. Before the wedding the official journals had brought
many proofs of her kindness of heart to the knowledge of the public—such
as, that the Empress, having beheld an accident to a poor workman who
fell from a scaffold, sprang from her coach to hasten to the aid of the
unfortunate man and had him carried to a hospital; and on another
occasion, seeing a poor abandoned child wandering in the street, the
Emperor’s bride had taken it into her own carriage and promised to
provide for its future. Still another and striking instance of this was
her refusal to accept a diamond necklace valued at six hundred thousand
francs which the Municipal Council of Paris had intended to present to
her. She wrote a most gracious letter conveying her thanks to the
Council for their loyal intention, but declaring she could not consent
that Paris should make so great a sacrifice in her behalf, or that the
Emperor’s wedding should lay any more burdens on the country; adding
that her sole desire was to share with the Emperor the affections of the
people, and expressing a wish that the six hundred thousand francs might
be devoted to charity. This could not fail to create a good impression;
and after the wedding many other examples of the same kind occurred. She
gave freely to all who approached her with petitions, conscious only
that help was needed; and many kind and consoling words accompanied the
large sums she privately bestowed. Indeed, in 1863 she went so far as to
insure her life in favor of the poor that they might not suffer by her
death; and she laid the foundations of many noble works of charity that
will cause her name to be honored long after she herself is forgotten.

Besides her generosity Eugénie possessed a thousand ways of attracting
and winning people to her. The Emperor’s love had raised her to the
throne; it depended solely on herself and her tact to maintain her
position on it. With her inborn dignity, her beauty, and her queenly
grace, she was as well equipped by nature for the part as any royal
princess; indeed many a sovereign born might well have envied her, as,
sparkling with jewels, she stood beneath the canopy of the throne to
receive the foreign diplomats and nobles of the Empire. When she
appeared on horseback beside the Emperor at grand reviews, or rode
through the city in the imperial coach, bowing in response to the shouts
of the dazzled crowds, nothing could have been more beautiful. It was
plain to all that the Empress well knew how to play her part.

Seldom have two persons better suited to one another than Napoleon and
Eugénie, or more completely in accord, been united. In all the pomp and
power of her sovereignty she never forgot that it was to him she owed it
all; and in proportion as the sense of her own importance rose, her love
and admiration for him increased also. In the eyes of the world he had
taken a step downward in his choice of a bride; it was now her task to
prove that “the adventuress” could be as useful to the dynasty as a
consort born in the purple.

“I would rather be spoken ill of than not be spoken of at all!” Louis
Napoleon had exclaimed when his first attempts to bring about a
political revolution had only excited pity and derision. Even at that
time he had studied the French people well, and knew their weak spot was
vanity. To flatter the national vanity therefore became one of his
principal agencies for maintaining his power; and while in private life
he loved an almost plebeian simplicity, in public no effect was too
striking or too spectacular to keep up his imperial state.

No one knew better than Eugénie how to arrange these brilliant effects.
Ever since the days when she was the companion of toreadors and the
heroine of the Corso, love of display and notoriety had been her ruling
passion. She may not have been conscious of this in the beginning, but
what was at first a habit became by degrees a necessity; and just as the
actress thirsts for applause, so Eugénie craved the admiration and
approval of the populace. As the actress eagerly searches the newspaper
columns after each appearance for the notices of her performance, so
Eugénie, after every public entertainment or review or excursion,
devoured the descriptions published of her costumes and appearance,
revelling in the praises lavished on her person, and spurred on thereby
to fresh efforts to win public favor. She studied the question of her
_toilettes_ as if it were a religion and she its high priestess. Most of
the fashions of that brilliant period were set by her, and the lists of
guests invited to court entertainments were subjected to her personal
supervision. Even ladies of high rank were sometimes refused admission
to the Tuileries should their costumes not suit Her Majesty.

Brought up among the Spanish aristocracy, famous for elegance and
stateliness of manner, and yet perfectly familiar with the lighter
customs of French society, Eugénie succeeded in imparting to her court a
tone of delicacy as well as luxury and magnificence that made it famous,
not only throughout France, but over half the world. Before she had been
a month on the throne, a thousand tales were circulated of her beauty,
wit, and generosity. The most enthusiastic accounts were printed of all
she said and did; and the attention of the public was so occupied with
her that it almost forgot to criticise the politics of the Emperor.
Wherever the imperial pair appeared they were surrounded by eager
throngs; and although here and there some expressions of disapproval
might be heard, the Parisians were dazzled by a magnificence of display
such as no other city of Europe could equal, and which conjured up
memories of a glorious past that filled their hearts with pride.




                               Chapter IV
                         State Visit to England


However the young Empress may have been regarded in other countries, it
was generally agreed that she understood better than any of her
predecessors how to hold the favor of the fickle Parisians. It was not
public homage, however, that Eugénie craved so much as recognition from
those princes and princesses who had scorned Mlle. Montijo, the
_parvenue_. It rankled deeply in her mind that she was not of royal
birth; and the most insignificant princess who could lay claim to the
sovereignty which she adored became an object of envy to her. Since she
could never hope to attain this or escape a past that must always serve
as a weapon against her, she centred all her desires on being accepted
as an equal by other reigning sovereigns and received as a guest in
their palaces. Thus for a short time, at least, her origin might be
forgotten.

To achieve this was by no means an easy task. All the crowned heads
carefully avoided Paris, nor with all her efforts could she even win
over the old aristocracy of France. Unable to comprehend that the
devotion of the Legitimists to _le Roy_ and his heir was a sacred
principle, linked with precious memories of the old kingly race, she
nevertheless admired their loyalty and resorted to every possible device
to lure the _grandes dames_ of the Faubourg St. Germain to her newly
established court. But willingly as they had borne the yoke of the
Bourbons, they were too proud to bend the knee before the Spaniard, and
made it plain that any overtures from the usurper of their rightful
sovereign’s throne would be rejected with contempt.

Compared with the sorrows of her after life, these humiliations were a
small matter; but galling as they were to her vanity, they were one of
the sharpest thorns in her new crown. In spite of her failure to win
over the old French nobility, she was not long in earning the respect of
the sovereigns of Europe. Her first opportunity was unexpectedly offered
by the Crimean War (1854-56) in which France’s victories restored the
country to its old place as foremost military power of Europe, and
greatly increased the importance of Napoleon. England had reaped
material advantage from the war and was loud in praise of the new
Empire, and Victoria was finally forced to invite the usurper and his
wife to visit her at Windsor. A personal acquaintance with the Queen of
England had long been Eugénie’s most ardent wish, and this invitation
afforded her the greatest satisfaction. Victoria had hitherto ignored
her in a very marked manner, while at the time of her marriage the
English journals had not only cast slurs upon her origin, but boldly
criticised her life and conduct. Thus it was doubly desirable for her to
be received at the court of England and to make a good impression there,
for could she but accomplish this, her position among other sovereigns
would be greatly strengthened. By no means certain as to the reception
that awaited her, she persuaded Napoleon to send over one of his
ministers in advance, ostensibly to arrange articles of peace with the
other powers, but charged at the same time to settle all questions of
etiquette concerning the impending visit.

The event itself, however, was of a kind to gratify the most susceptible
vanity and the most aspiring ambition. Toward evening of the sixteenth
of April, 1855, Napoleon and Eugénie with their suite landed on the
shores of England, and on the following day set out on their journey to
London, accompanied by the Prince Consort. Every town and village on
their route was gaily decorated. They were greeted everywhere with the
greatest enthusiasm. As they passed through Hyde Park, a long line of
aristocratic equipages and equestrians was drawn up on either side. At
Windsor triumphal arches had been erected. Shops were closed, houses
decorated, and the whole town was on foot to greet Their Majesties. Amid
the shouts and cheers of the populace they entered the old castle, where
Victoria welcomed them most cordially, having personally seen to all the
arrangements for her guests’ comfort.

The day after their arrival the Queen bestowed the Order of the Garter
on Napoleon. Following this impressive ceremony was a state banquet at
which the famous Windsor gold service made its appearance; and at the
gala performance in the court theatre that evening a verse in honor of
Napoleon was interpolated in the English National hymn. The next day
London held a grand celebration. The Emperor and Empress were lauded in
the most flattering songs and speeches; and the people who had been the
deadly enemies of Napoleon the First, the country in which Prince Louis
Napoleon had lived as a refugee, ill, friendless, often in dire need,
now hailed Napoleon the Third as its friend and ally.

The results of this visit to Great Britain were most gratifying to the
imperial pair. The enthusiasm of the British made an excellent
impression in France and strengthened public confidence in Napoleon’s
wisdom and prudence, while the friendship of the English royal family
added importance to the young dynasty in Germany, and left no excuse for
other sovereign houses to hold aloof from the Tuileries. Lastly, not
only were Eugénie’s fondest hopes realized, but she had also made a
life-long friend. At their very first meeting Eugénie’s charm completely
won the Queen’s heart. This beautiful woman with her ease and dignity of
manner bore little resemblance to the notorious belle of gay resorts as
she had been described; and forgetting all these unpleasant rumors, she
succumbed at once to the Empress’s attractions. The friendship thus
begun grew closer with subsequent meetings and continued unbroken for
many years.

A few months later, the Queen of England with her husband and two eldest
children came to Paris to return her new friend’s visit. For more than
four hundred years no English sovereign had visited the French capital,
so it was an event of great importance. The Queen, who writes with
enthusiasm in her diary of the journey to France, describes their
reception as follows:

“On the eighteenth of August we left Osborne about five o’clock in the
morning on our yacht, the Victoria and Albert, reaching Boulogne about
two, where we were greeted with shouts of welcome from the people and
troops drawn up along the shore. The Emperor, with his staff, stood
waiting in the sun till the gangplank was thrown out, when he stepped
aboard. I went forward to meet him, and he kissed my hand. We four, that
is, the Prince, the Prince of Wales, Princess Victoria, and myself, then
entered a coach and drove through the streets, everywhere crowded with
people and beautifully decorated with flags, to the railway station, the
Emperor accompanying us on horseback.”

In the capital great preparations had been made for their reception,
Napoleon having ridden about everywhere in person to see that all was
complete. At the railway station, which was covered with floral
decorations, eighty beautiful young girls were waiting to present the
Queen with bouquets. Through a sea of light from lamps and torches, amid
the strains of music, the rolling of drums, and incessant cheering, the
royal party made its way through the Bois to St. Cloud, where the
Empress, Princess Mathilde, and all the ladies of the court were waiting
to receive it.

The World’s Exposition had just been opened in Paris at that time, and
the week spent by the English guests at the French court was devoted to
seeing that, as well as the sights of the city itself. Besides this, a
number of state entertainments were given in their honor, concluding
with a ball at Versailles that exceeded in magnificence any given since
the time of Louis the Fourteenth. Three thousand invitations were issued
for this, and all the _élite_ of France were present, with many
distinguished foreigners. The gay uniforms and court dresses of the men
and the gorgeous costumes of the ladies, who vied with one another in
their display of jewels, laces, and brocades, made a scene of surpassing
brilliancy.

The Empress, who appeared at this ball in all her radiant loveliness,
was taken ill during the supper and obliged to retire to her own
apartments. On several other occasions also she was indisposed and
forced to excuse herself. Yet though unable to take an active part in
public festivities, Eugénie and Victoria became all the more intimate in
their own private circle. Napoleon and the Prince Consort sang duets
together. Victoria made several sketches of the country about St. Cloud
and often visited Eugénie in her own apartments where the two princesses
sat for hours together in confidential talk. A friendship so close and
lasting between such widely different natures must have been founded on
more than physical attraction. A mutual appreciation of each other’s
best qualities drew them together. Eugénie was bolder and more
independent than her friend, and freer from prejudice; but Victoria had
the strength and repose that come from an inherited consciousness of
power, while they were united by a common devotion to their own

                      Birth of the Prince Imperial


Early on the morning of the sixteenth of March, 1856, a son was born to
the imperial pair, and a salute of a hundred and one guns proclaimed the
great news to the public, who received it with the wildest enthusiasm.
The whole city was decorated with flags, garlands, and portraits of the
Emperor and Empress, and ablaze with illuminations at night; while the
City Council granted a sum of two hundred thousand francs for a feast
for the poor. Greater still was the joy of the royal parents. The
Emperor took the little Prince in his arms and carried him out to show
to the assembled court, with tears of pride and happiness. He at once
ordered a million francs to be distributed in charity to celebrate the
event; had it publicly proclaimed that he and the Empress would act as
sponsors to all legitimate children born on that day within the borders
of his Empire, and issued a decree permitting all political exiles to
return to France on condition that they would swear to uphold the
Government and obey the laws of the country.

Soon after the birth of the Prince Imperial a congress met to determine
the articles of peace which concluded the Crimean War and restored the
peace of Europe, and Napoleon was appointed arbiter. At the zenith of
his power and with the future of his dynasty seemingly secured, it did
not appear altogether presumptuous when in replying to the
congratulations of the Assembly he expressed a hope in the brightness of
his son’s future as heir to the throne of France.

Eugénie’s position was greatly strengthened by this happy event, for
now, should she survive her husband (as seemed probable from the
difference in their ages), as mother of Napoleon the Fourth she would
have still greater influence in public affairs. Her marriage to Napoleon
the Third had revived memories of Josephine. Like the wife of the great
Emperor she had been born under a southern sky; like her she had seemed
destined from the cradle to wear a crown; and as long as she remained
childless there were not lacking hints that a similar fate might be in
store for her. But Providence had ordained otherwise. As a mother
Eugénie was seated more firmly than ever on the throne of France, and
universally regarded with respect, almost with reverence. Gifts flowed
in from all sides. No less than twenty-eight orders were bestowed on the
baby Prince. Messages of congratulation came from all parts of the
Empire. Even the fishwives of the Halle came to offer their good wishes,
and engravings of the Empress and her child were scattered by hundreds
of thousands throughout the country.

In the early Summer of 1856, terrific floods caused much suffering and
distress in many parts of France, in consequence of which there was some
talk of having the Prince Imperial’s christening celebrated quietly.
Unwilling, however, to lose an opportunity of showing the world that his
dynasty, though young in years was inferior to none of the older
monarchies in wealth and splendor, Napoleon determined to send the flood
victims one half of the sum which would originally have been devoted to
the christening festivities, and with the other half he still managed to
make an impressive display.

Not for many years had there been such excitement in Paris as on that
summer day, which was to witness the baptism of the heir of Napoleon the
Third. At six o’clock in the morning the pealing of bells and the
thunder of cannon proclaimed that the great day had come, and at the
first sound, swarms of eager spectators poured into the streets. All the
boulevards and squares were filled in a few hours, and by the time
incoming trains had deposited their freight of strangers and
provincials, the crowds were so dense it was impossible to cross the
Seine. A deafening shout greeted the appearance of the gilded state
coach bearing the little Prince with his governess and nurse; nor was
the enthusiasm lessened when close behind followed the happy parents
with their suite. No less a person than the Holy Father at Rome was
godfather to the Spaniard’s child, while Queen Josephine of Norway and
Sweden acted as godmother. The ceremony at Notre Dame was most striking
and impressive. All the clergy of France were present; on entering the
great shadowy Cathedral, dimly lighted by the myriad wax tapers on the
altar, one might easily have imagined himself suddenly transported to a
scene in the Middle Ages.

That evening the city of Paris gave a magnificent banquet in honor of
the imperial family, at which the whole court and many foreign guests
were present. It was held in the great hall of the Hôtel de Ville, lit
up by eighteen thousand wax candles. The silver service used was made
expressly for the occasion at a cost of two hundred and fifty thousand
francs and the flowers alone came to twenty thousand francs. Two
orchestras alternated in furnishing music; and at the close all present
rose and sang “_Vive l’Empereur!_” The popularity of the Empress was
proven by a surprise that had been prepared for her in the form of a
diorama representing the various places with which she had some special
association:—Granada her birthplace; Madrid, with the Prado; the forest
of Compiègne; Fontainebleau, where the Emperor had confessed his love
for her; the chamber which she had occupied in the Élysée before her
marriage; the wedding of the imperial pair at Notre Dame; the Prince
Imperial’s apartment at the Tuileries; the palace of St. Cloud; and the
cascade in the Bois de Boulogne. At the conclusion of the banquet
Napoleon and Eugénie appeared on one of the balconies of the Hôtel de
Ville and were greeted with the wildest enthusiasm by the crowds that
had gathered to admire the fireworks and the illuminations. All were
charmed with the Emperor’s graciousness and the beauty of the Empress,
but most of all with the little Prince Imperial whom the people
affectionately nicknamed “Lulu.”[1]




                               Chapter VI
                        The Empress in Politics


Napoleon’s position at this time seemed impregnable. France had played
an honorable part in the Crimean War and covered herself with glory at
the fall of Sebastopol. Yet the nephew of the great Napoleon had
remained far from the field of battle himself, and felt the need of
winning some personal laurels to add to his prestige. The shrewd policy
of Count Cavour, the Italian statesman, had greatly increased the power
of the kingdom of Sardinia; and thither the Emperor now turned his
glances. At a secret meeting with Cavour he guaranteed the support of
France to Sardinia in case of war with Austria; but before this pledge
could be redeemed an event occurred which might have made the agreement
of little avail. It deserves mention here as furnishing a proof of
Eugénie’s courage.

On the eleventh of January, 1858, a special performance of grand opera
was to be given, and a crowd of loyal subjects had gathered about the
theatre to witness the arrival of the sovereigns. As the state coach
drew up before the entrance, two bombs were hurled at it, and a
frightful explosion followed. Windows in all the neighboring streets
were shattered, and a hundred and sixty persons, among them a number of
soldiers and outriders, were killed or badly wounded. A fragment of
shell pierced the Emperor’s hat; and Eugénie, who tried to protect her
husband’s body with her own, received a slight graze on the temple,
bespattering her white silk dress with blood. Yet, perfectly calm and
undismayed, she stood up at once and called out words of reassurance to
the panic-stricken people. As if nothing had happened, Their Majesties
entered the theatre, and with her usual winning smile the Empress bowed
her thanks to the burst of applause that greeted them. Felix Orsini, the
Italian who had thrown the bombs, was immediately seized and thrown into
prison with his accomplices.

In a proclamation issued on January first, 1859, the Emperor revealed
his intention of severing friendly relations with Austria; and on the
outbreak of war between that country and Sardinia, he hastened to the
support of his new ally, May 10, 1859, publicly declaring that “Italy
must be free from the Alps to the Adriatic.” The victories of Magenta
and Solferino, which followed, added fresh glories to the arms of
France; and although the peace of Villafranca failed to redeem all his
lofty promises, Napoleon was hailed as the deliverer of Italy.

Meanwhile there had been a change in the Government at home which
greatly added to Eugénie’s importance. Shortly after Orsini’s
unsuccessful attempt, the Assembly passed a law appointing her Regent of
France in the Emperor’s absence, or during her son’s minority in case of
his death; and on Napoleon’s departure for Italy the reins of government
were placed for the first time in her hands. It was a critical period at
which to confide the direction of affairs to a woman; had the war been
less fortunate in its issue, the situation might have proved as
dangerous as it afterwards became, in 1870.

If any decisive influence on French politics was attributed to Eugénie
on this or subsequent occasions, it was a mistaken idea. As a matter of
fact her regency was little more than an empty farce in which Napoleon
allowed his wife to play the chief part. It deluded the people and
flattered the Empress to see her name at the head of all state
documents; but absent or present, although he permitted Eugénie to share
in the ministerial councils, he was careful not to trust the reins of
government for any length of time to other hands than his own. On the
other hand, it cannot be denied that the Empress, when she chose to
exert herself, well knew how to achieve her ends. Once an idea became
fixed in her mind she would assail the Emperor with arguments and
entreaties until he finally yielded, if only for the sake of peace; nor
did she scruple to intrigue against the ministers when they refused to
carry out her wishes in the bestowal of honors and positions on
favorites of her own, often quite unworthy of such favors.

Her real political influence was greatly overestimated. Her talents did
not lie in that direction, nor had she any conception of the intricate
machinery of government. Absorbed in a thousand trifles, court
festivals, fashions, and intrigues, she had neither time nor inclination
to pursue such aims with any system or resolution. Yet there was one
case in which she did make trouble by her interference. This was shortly
before the Franco-Prussian War, when she brought all her influence to
bear in behalf of the Church.

The Papal party had spared no pains to secure Eugénie’s friendship and
strengthen her in the conviction that she had been chosen by Providence
as one of the chief supports of God’s vicegerent on earth. Full of
gratitude to the Deity for this special mark of favor, and firmly
believing in her destiny, she yielded blindly to all the wishes of the
clergy, thus openly proclaiming herself the head of the clerical party.
She devoted her energies to the support of the Papal power and to a
revival of the spirit of Catholicism throughout the country. No mercy was
shown to those who dissented from the old faith. Even her attendants,
with few exceptions, were chosen according to their religious views.
Naturally this overzealousness could not fail to excite much opposition,
and Eugénie soon had not only the envy and prejudice of society to
contend against, but the enmity of the free-thinkers, including many of
Napoleon’s best friends.

Of these, Prince Napoleon was the most bitter. Quite as firmly as
Napoleon the Third believed it his mission to be sovereign of France,
did this Prince feel himself destined to the throne; but while the
former supported his ideas with Napoleonic tactics, the latter based his
claims chiefly on a remarkable likeness to the first Emperor. Louis
Napoleon had worked hard to attain his goal. His cousin contented
himself with spending hours before his mirror, arranging the Napoleonic
lock of hair upon his forehead—a sign that he should one day wear the
crown of France. As long as the Emperor was without issue he regarded
himself as certainly the heir. The birth of the Prince Imperial
therefore was a bitter blow to him; and when the law was passed giving
Eugénie the power of Regent, his rage and chagrin knew no bounds. He had
never been able to endure the Spaniard, but had hidden his dislike at
first under a mask of cold politeness. Now that he no longer had any
reason for concealing his true feelings, he gave full vent to his
malice, annoying the Empress constantly by petty personal attacks, and
circulating the most shameful reports concerning her private life.

Eugénie returned the Prince’s hatred with all her heart. His dissolute
life, evil tongue, and above all, the cowardice he had shown on more
than one glaring occasion, made him detestable to her. She retaliated by
exposing this side of his character on every possible occasion, thus
provoking him constantly to fresh attacks. The relation between them was
not improved by the Prince’s marriage in January, 1859, to Clothilde of
Savoy, the lovely young Princess to whom the people of Paris gave the
name of St. Clothilde. He knew that his marriage to a royal princess
would enrage the Empress. While Clothilde had yielded to her father’s
wishes in the matter, personally she felt nothing but aversion for the
cynical, dissolute free-thinker, for many years the avowed lover of the
actress Rachel; nor was he a person likely to capture the fancy of
Victor Emanuel’s innocent young daughter.

At court, as in her own household, Clothilde stood well-nigh alone,
therefore. She excited the jealousy rather than the sympathy of
Eugénie—while in her own heart the Princess of royal birth felt little
but contempt for the adventurous Empress. She absented herself from
court as much as possible and gathered about her a little circle of her
own, those aristocrats who had scorned to pay homage to the Countess
Montijo. Yet whenever obliged to appear at the Imperial Court, she
fulfilled all the requirements of her position with charming dignity.
Once when Eugénie, who found court etiquette most tiresome and
fatiguing, asked if it did not weary her, she replied innocently,
unconscious of the sting that lay within the words, “Certainly not! I
have been accustomed to it all my life.”

Although Prince Napoleon was the most hated of all Eugénie’s enemies, he
was by no means the only member of the Emperor’s family who disliked
her. Even the kindly, gentle Princess Mathilde looked askance at her
cousin’s wife, though she was tactful enough not to betray her feeling.
Napoleon’s friendly attachment for her had continued even after his
marriage, and he used often to ask her advice in important matters; but
the Empress never visited her, and the Princess, who had once presided
at the Tuileries, no longer appeared there except on state occasions
when it was unavoidable.

The general feeling against Eugénie that prevailed did not find open
expression till 1861, when the Emperor returned as victor to his capital
from Italy. The Italian people had chosen Victor Emanuel as their
sovereign, and the unity of that country met with such approval in
France, that when Napoleon failed formally to recognize the new order of
things, many attributed his delay to Eugénie’s influence. As a devout
Catholic she would gladly have seen the hated Victor Emanuel’s kingdom
overthrown and the Pope’s supremacy restored; and while Napoleon can
scarcely have shared these feelings, he realized that it was to his
interest to keep on good terms with the clerical party, and that to
renounce the friendship of the Pope would deprive him of a powerful
support. He therefore permitted the Pope to retain Rome and the
“Patrimonium St. Petri,” and, on the Empress’s insistence, he agreed to
leave a body of French troops in Italy to defend the Papal interests, at
the same time publicly recognizing Victor Emanuel as King of Italy, and
the provinces revolting from the Church as parts of the new kingdom.
This vacillating course pleased neither party, and blame was laid
chiefly on the Empress, whose zeal for the Papacy was but too well
known. Her exclamation, “If the Pope leaves the Quirinal, I shall leave
the Tuileries! I would rather have the Emperor murdered than see him
delivered over to everlasting damnation!” passed from mouth to mouth and
added still further to the prejudice against her among the intelligent
population of France.




                              Chapter VII
                      Private Life of the Empress


Besides the annoyances caused by the ill-will of the anti-clerical
party, Eugénie at this time had also sorrows and anxieties of her own to
endure. Painful as her youthful passion for the Duke of Alva had been,
it had failed to affect the close affection of the two sisters—an
attachment that only deepened as time went on. The Duchess and her
husband frequently spent their winters in Paris, and were always sure of
a cordial welcome from the imperial pair.

Eugénie’s life before her marriage was one of such freedom that although
she fulfilled all her duties as sovereign with dignity and apparent
content, there were many lonely hours when her thoughts turned longingly
to those youthful days in Spain and to the dear ones there, especially
her mother, with whom the Duchess of Alva was now her only link. The
Duchess had been afflicted for some time with an incurable malady,
though Eugénie was ignorant of its serious nature. While travelling with
the Emperor in August, 1860, she was shocked to receive word that her
sister’s condition had changed greatly for the worse. The august
travellers were then in Algiers, and Eugénie begged Napoleon to turn
back at once. But elaborate preparations had been made for their
entertainment and to abandon the festivities would have been too great a
disappointment to the people. Torn with anxiety, the Empress attended a
grand ball given in their honor, and not till it was over did she learn
the sad truth that her sister was dying. She sailed at once for France,
but it was too late. Before she reached land the Duchess had expired. It
was a terrible blow to Eugénie; overcome with grief she shut herself up
in her own apartments, refusing to see any one. It was months before she
recovered herself sufficiently to appear again in court circles.

Nor was this all. Although Napoleon’s marriage with the beautiful
Spaniard had been one of love alone, yet the passion with which she
inspired him gradually cooled, and although he continued to treat his
wife invariably with the same respect and admiration he had shown in
their early married life, there were many occasions when he gave her
cause for jealousy.

In these conjugal trials the Duchess of Alva had been her confidante and
had helped her through many bitter hours. Now that this gentle comforter
was gone she felt doubly the neglect so hard for her warm and generous
nature to endure; and these sorrows, added to anxiety for the health of
her son, cast a permanent shadow over her bright spirits. She fell more
and more under the influence of the priesthood, devoted herself to
religious works, had new convents built, and even thought of making a
pilgrimage to Jerusalem. This plan was afterwards abandoned, but her
irritability, capriciousness, and bigotry reduced her household to
desperation. The constant alternations of religious frenzy and feverish
pursuit of pleasure, of extreme gayety and deepest melancholy,
characteristic of the Empress’s later life, were no doubt due to an
overwrought nervous system, like the hysterical fits of laughing or
weeping that often seized her without any apparent cause. But with so
gay and sanguine a temperament as hers, these moods never lasted long;
and her warm-heartedness never failed to win the affection of those
about her.

Among the friendships formed by Eugénie, that with the Princess
Metternich is of especial interest, since no lady of the Imperial Court
was so much talked of and criticised as the young wife of the Austrian
ambassador. From Vienna, where they had been favorites at the Austrian
court, the Metternichs had come to Paris in 1860, shortly after the
conclusion of peace between Italy, France, and Austria, and soon after
their own marriage. Born of one of the oldest and most distinguished
families in the country, Pauline Metternich was at once a type of the
proud aristocrat and the gay, witty, thoughtless Viennese, full of
original and daring ideas, which she took no pains to conceal. In the
days of the Empire the Austrian Embassy was the rendezvous of all the
rank, wealth, and intellect of Paris. Disciples of art and literature,
diplomats and government officials and Legitimists from St. Germain met
in these salons. Even the Emperor and Empress often made their
appearance there.

At their very first meeting the Princess had conceived the greatest
admiration for Eugénie; and with the exception of her young niece Anna
Murat (afterward Duchess of Monchy), for whom the Empress had an almost
motherly affection, no one was so close to her as the Princess
Metternich. Perfect sympathy of tastes, and a certain magnetic
attraction for which there is no explanation, proved the foundation of
an intimate friendship that lasted for years. Pauline’s sparkling wit
and vivacity were of just the sort to strike a responsive chord in so
lively a nature as Eugénie’s. She was the soul of all the _fêtes_ at
Compiègne and Fontainebleau, and added to the long evenings at court a
life and gayety they often sadly lacked.

At home the Princess Metternich was an excellent wife and mother, and
attended personally to every detail of her household. In society,
however, she disregarded all conventions, spoke her mind freely on all
occasions, and had the courage to stand up for her convictions. The
brilliant witticisms and clever sayings attributed to her are
numberless; they were repeated not only among the court and diplomatic
circles, but even by the public. Her influence in the world of fashion
was almost equal to that of the Empress, but she was always causing
painful embarrassments to her imitators. One day she would appear
dressed with a simplicity and plainness that would not have been
permitted in any one else; the next, her costume would be of a
costliness no one could possibly hope to rival. She was a clever mimic,
and would delight the whole court with her imitations of Madame Thérèse,
a well known music-hall singer, the Empress usually leading in the
applause; yet on formal occasions no one at court could appear with
greater dignity and stateliness. In fact Eugénie’s fondness for her was
partly founded on that weakness for birth and rank of which we have
already spoken. She was peculiarly sensitive as to her own origin, and
no greater insult could be inflicted upon her than any allusion to it.
The French authoress Olympe Andouard relates an instance of this that
almost severed the friendship between Eugénie and the Princess
Metternich.

It was during one of the court evenings at Fontainebleau which happened
to be most dull and tedious. Among those present, as usual, was the wife
of the Austrian ambassador to whom private apartments had been assigned
in a wing of the palace. Weary at last of the monotony, Pauline
whispered to a friend that she would feign a bad headache and retire to
her own rooms, whither the friend was to follow quietly with a dozen
chosen ladies and cavaliers. No sooner said than done. The headache
served as an excuse. The Princess withdrew and hastily prepared to
receive her guests, who soon succeeded in stealing away unobserved. All
was going well. The music and dancing were at their height, when
suddenly the door opened and Eugénie appeared—to inquire for her poor
Pauline whose “frightful headache” had filled her with sympathy. In
spite of her nervous temperament Eugénie on certain occasions (usually
unimportant) was not lacking in the necessary calm and self-possession.
Instead of laughing at the lively scene before her, she was indignant
and reproved the Princess sharply for her lack of proper respect.

“Madame!” replied the diplomat’s wife no less hotly, “you forget that I
was born a great lady and submit to no reprimands!”

In consequence of this scene the Princess was forced to absent herself
from court for a time, and only by degrees was the old familiarity
restored.

Next to Pauline Metternich the most important member of the Empress’s
small private circle was Prosper Merimée, the clever author—“the
Empress’s court jester,” as he laughingly called himself. He had first
met the Countess Montijo while Eugénie was still a child, and the
acquaintance had ripened with years into a close friendship which was
shared by the imperial pair. Although not strictly speaking a member of
the court, both Napoleon and Eugénie treated him as a member of their
family, and the bigoted Empress not only honored him as a gifted author,
but felt an almost sisterly affection for the avowed free-thinker.




                              Chapter VIII
                     Paris under the Second Empire


The Danish writer, Hermann Bang, says:

  “It was a strangely mixed society that formed the court of the Second
  Empire, and during this splendid period Paris became more than ever a
  brilliant social arena. New names and new celebrities sprang up like
  mushrooms and withered away as quickly. Since life was short, it must
  needs be rapid. Looking back upon it now, one is reminded of a
  juggler’s performance at the circus. The glittering balls fly about in
  bewildering numbers and seem to fill the whole air. Different
  performers come and go, but the dazzling display continues. This
  society was neither composed of the representative families of France
  nor yet of the mass of the population, who supported the Government,
  and to whom the Second Empire seemed a complete restoration of the
  glories of the First. Truly the richest legacy of greatness is the
  magic that lies in a name.”

Napoleon was well aware of the value of the name he bore. He had not
forgotten that to it alone he owed his possession of the throne; and he
determined that the name at which Europe had trembled and which all
France adored should serve as the foundation of his power. As far as
possible he tried to revive all the Napoleonic traditions and preserve
the fond illusion of the Parisians. Everything about the court was
conducted on a scale of the greatest magnificence. Uniforms of
officials, ministers, and deputies were a mass of gold embroidery. The
gorgeousness of the palace guards suggested the operatic stage; customs
of the time of Louis the Fourteenth were even revived. Visits from
foreign sovereigns were attended with an almost fabulous display, and
with Napoleon’s rising importance these visits became more and more
frequent. Indeed there were times during the Second Empire when whole
solar systems of potentates revolved about one another.

On Thursday evenings during the winter, dinners were given at the
Tuileries for diplomats and state officials, followed by receptions and
dancing. Four court balls were given in the course of the season, to
which as many as five thousand invitations were issued, and which were
marked by the utmost splendor. Both sides of the grand staircase were
lined with palace guards. Guests waited in the galleries until the
arrival of the sovereigns, when the doors of the great salon were thrown
open and the Emperor and Empress took their places on the dais, the
princes and princesses grouped about them. The Empress danced only the
opening quadrille on these occasions, and at eleven retired with the
Emperor to a smaller salon where there was also dancing.

Eugénie possessed the truly royal gift of never forgetting a face or a
name, and always had a kindly word or glance for every one as she passed
through the crowded room; but when it was over and she reached her own
apartments, she would be completely exhausted with the weight of the
crown jewels, which she wore in the greatest profusion on these
occasions. Sometimes she would not even wait for her women, but would
snatch off the crown and heavy ornaments and toss them into the lap of
the lady-in-waiting, who bore them carefully away, for each was worth a
fortune. Besides these grand balls to which any one with the slightest
claim to rank or position could easily obtain admission, the most
splendid and original masquerades were given in Carnival time, to which
invitations were more limited. During Lent there were no entertainments
with the exception of four state concerts given under the direction of
Auber, then court _kapellmeister_, and Count Bacciocchi, director of the
theatre, in which all the most famous artists took part.

Far more interesting than these semi-official affairs were the weekly
Monday receptions held by the Empress in her own apartments. Only a
select few were invited to these, and the Empress’s “Mondays” soon
became famous all over Europe. Napoleon and Eugénie received their
guests with the greatest cordiality, and conversed familiarly with all.
Here Princess Metternich shone her brightest; here too were seen the
beautiful Princess Murat, Duchess of Monchy; the gallant Count Walewski,
who so closely resembled his father, the great Napoleon; the Emperor’s
half-brother, the Duke de Morny; and his youthful friend and ally Duke
Fialni de Persigny. Here Merimée’s inexhaustible fund of wit and humor
found full play. Here the Emperor’s favorite, General Fleury, and the
elegant Marquis de Caux (afterward the husband of Adelina Patti) led the
cotillon and invented figures that made the rounds of Europe.

Scarcely less famous in their way were the hunting parties held by the
court at Compiègne every autumn. To these only a few were invited at a
time, and the weekly list of guests was prepared with as much care as if
it had been some important affair of state. Fifteen new gowns of the
costliest kind were regarded as indispensable by the feminine world for
a visit to Compiègne. Many feigned illness to escape the expense of so
many new _toilettes_, while others were almost ruined by accepting the
invitations. Art, literature, and science were well represented at these
gatherings; and once arrived at Compiègne, all received the most cordial
welcome, no matter what their political opinions.

Next to court entertainments the most popular rendezvous for the world
of fashion in the days of the Empire was the opera; and although it then
had its home in the narrow _Rue Lepelletier_, instead of its present
magnificent palace, this did not deter royalty and all the highest
society from attending regularly. Full dress was required, and the
costly gowns and the jewels of the ladies, with the brilliant uniforms
of the men, lent an air of festivity to each performance that is usually
seen only on some gala occasion. But if grand opera were the temple of
art in which Eugénie showed herself most often, it was by no means her
favorite place of amusement. She not only lacked all knowledge of the
higher music, but it was distasteful to her; and even well written drama
at the Théâtre Français had no interest for her. On the other hand, she
adored anything amusing and had the greatest fondness for Offenbach’s
lively airs. Her musical taste may be judged by the fact that during the
Czar Alexander of Russia’s stay in Paris in 1867, she could think of no
greater mark of attention than to send him tickets for a performance of
the “Grande Duchesse de Gerolstein.”

Her fancied resemblance to Marie Antoinette has already been mentioned;
indeed, there were many points of similarity between the Spanish
Countess and Maria Theresa’s unfortunate daughter. Both possessed
remarkable beauty, charm, energy, and strength of character. Both were
boundlessly extravagant and open-handed, as both in their younger days
allowed the pursuit of pleasure to banish all serious occupations.
Eugénie avoided the imprudences of which Marie Antoinette was guilty,
and instead of risking her popularity, did all in her power to preserve
and strengthen it; yet she too was powerless to escape calumny. There
were but too many evil tongues ready to suggest that a woman who owed
her sovereignty to beauty alone was scarce likely to remain a pattern of
virtue, and we have seen how even in her own family she had enemies who
tried to undermine her reputation.

The court of the Second Empire was full of corruption and was abandoned
to a life of pleasure and luxury. But it is ever the way of aristocratic
society to seek amusement; and if at the courts of Berlin and London a
more serious tone prevailed, those of Vienna, St. Petersburg, and Madrid
were scarcely less frivolous than that of France under the Second
Empire.

The Empress’s daily life was very different from this; intermixed with
the feverish pursuit of pleasure were many days of weariness and ennui.
At eight o’clock she rose and devoted an hour regularly, sometimes two
or three, to her favorite occupation, the study of her _toilettes_. At
half-past eleven she breakfasted alone with the Emperor and the Prince
Imperial, after which Napoleon would smoke a cigarette in his wife’s
apartment, chatting and playing with his little son. Kindness of heart
was one of the Emperor’s most marked characteristics. Indeed he was
often over-indulgent with the child—a weakness Eugénie continually
struggled against, with the natural result that the little Prince
preferred his father to his mother. At one, every day he went for his
drive in the Bois de Boulogne, and the Empress retired to her study,
back of the audience chamber, where no one was allowed to enter. Here
her tastes and habits were best displayed, for in this room she had
surrounded herself with all her most precious possessions, portraits of
her family and intimate friends, busts, vases, statuettes, and all sorts
of personal souvenirs, and a small set of bookshelves containing the
works of French, Spanish, English, and Italian writers. Every day
Eugénie wrote to her mother, a sacred duty with which neither _fête_ nor
illness, travel nor court entertainment, was ever allowed to interfere.
Among others with whom she also kept up a lively correspondence were
Queen Victoria and the Queen of Holland. After the Empress’s personal
letters were finished she summoned her secretary, Damas Hinard, with
whom she went through the vast number of begging letters and appeals of
all kinds she received daily, to each of which she gave her personal
attention.

Adjoining Eugénie’s bedchamber was an anteroom without windows in which
a lamp was always burning, and from which a narrow stairway led to the
Emperor’s apartments. Concealed in the wainscoting of this room by
sliding panels were a number of caskets, all numbered and marked in
cipher. To look over and arrange their contents was one of Eugénie’s
favorite amusements. Here she kept not only her own private papers, but
many interesting contributions to the history of Napoleon the First and
his times, in the form of letters from statesmen, soldiers, and scholars.
All the Emperor’s discarded documents and correspondence were carefully
preserved by Eugénie, and stored away where only she could get at them.
Napoleon was much amused at this mania of hers for collecting, and she
herself used to laugh over it.

“I am like a little mouse, running around after the Emperor and picking
up all the crumbs he lets fall,” she once said.

The ladies-in-waiting did not live in the Tuileries; it was only during
the summer that they were constantly with her, whether travelling about
or at one of the summer palaces. Of these, some were naturally more
congenial than others, but Eugénie had no choice in the matter of a
companion; this was regulated strictly by the law of precedence. Day
after day she entered her carriage, accompanied by whichever lady was
entitled by etiquette to a seat in the imperial equipage, and drove
through the Bois, bowing incessantly to left and right, and day after
day she returned at exactly the same hour in time to dress for dinner.

Besides these monotonous outings, she sometimes drove out in the morning
in a carriage drawn by only two horses. Each man and footman wore the
plainest livery, and she and her companion were quite simply dressed. On
these occasions she attended to all her charitable errands. She liked to
investigate in person all the cases that especially appealed to her
sympathies, and always carried with her a well filled purse, the money
thus dispensed often amounting to a considerable sum in the course of a
year.

“I could just as well send what I give to the poor,” she declared, “but
one should do a little good oneself. The sight of so much misery and
suffering makes it easier to bear one’s own troubles.”

Of all the Empress’s attendants the one to whom she was most attached
was Madame Pollet, or Pépa as she called her. This woman, the only
Spaniard in her service, had entered it in early youth, and remained
with her ever after. She had accompanied her on all her travels and
shared all the vicissitudes of her mistress, whom she adored and for
whom she would have gladly died. She had charge of the Empress’s
wardrobe and personal belongings, and was untiring in her efforts to
fulfil the slightest wish of Eugénie, who on her part, while she never
allowed the distance between them to be forgotten, returned the
affection and reposed the most boundless confidence in Pépa. Madame
Pollet was supposed to have great influence with the Empress, and wives
of high officials were not ashamed to court her favor and load her with
gifts when they wanted something of her mistress. But Pépa, a modest
little creature, had no desire to meddle with matters that did not
concern her; besides she was far too busy and too much in demand by
Eugénie to have time for other things.

The dinner hour at the Tuileries was half-past seven. At this meal the
Prince Imperial, after his eighth year, was present as well as all the
ladies and gentlemen of the court. Shortly before the hour, the Emperor
went to his wife’s apartments and escorted her to the Hall of Apollo,
where the court awaited Their Majesties. As soon as dinner was served
the palace prefect was notified, who in turn informed the Emperor;
Napoleon gave his arm to Eugénie and the rest followed in order of rank.
The ceremony was simple but strictly in accordance with etiquette. At
table a young blackamoor, whom she had brought with her from Algiers,
always stood behind Eugénie’s chair, and waited on her with as lofty an
air as if he were fulfilling some sacred office. He was said to be of
noble birth, and proudly refused to serve any one but the Empress.

After dinner, which was served with such smoothness and precision that
it seldom lasted more than three-quarters of an hour, the court returned
to the Hall of Apollo, where the evening was spent, usually in a most
tedious manner. The presence of the sovereigns prevented any spontaneous
general conversation. The Emperor himself rarely spoke at all, while
Eugénie, finding this atmosphere of repression unbearable, talked
incessantly with the nervous vivacity peculiar to her. To vary the
monotony of these evenings, reading aloud was sometimes suggested but it
was difficult to find anything suitable for such an assemblage. A French
or English romance would entertain the Empress but bored the Emperor
horribly; while if a scientific work that interested Napoleon were
chosen, Eugénie would yawn, therefore this too had to be abandoned.

The Emperor was fond of solitaire, which he often played; but it did not
amuse Eugénie except when she did not feel like talking, which was
seldom the case. There was never music or card-playing at the palace.
Once in a great while the Empress would have a sudden fancy to do
something, as when, for example, late one evening a courtier was hastily
despatched to procure all the necessary materials for making artificial
flowers, that she might learn the art at once. On another occasion it
was the desire to model in clay that must be gratified on the spot.

Punctually at ten, a table was brought in with tea and cakes, which the
ladies served themselves, and conversation now became general. Between
eleven and twelve the Empress withdrew to her own apartments and
generally retired at once though she sometimes kept her reader, Mlle.
Bouvet, to read aloud to her after she was in bed. As a general rule,
however, she preferred to read to herself which she did often and very
rapidly.




                               Chapter IX
                     Eugénie as a Leader of Fashion


The stairways and corridors in the Tuileries were so dark that they had
to be lighted summer and winter; and this, with the bad ventilation,
made the palace so unbearable in warm weather that the court spent the
summer months away from Paris, at Fontainebleau, St. Cloud, or Biarritz.
Of these resorts Napoleon’s favorite was St. Cloud, where he usually
went to recuperate from the severe attacks of illness to which he was
subject. Here he was quite happy, playing with his dog Nero, a faithful
companion for many years, or tending his roses in the palace garden.

Eugénie, on her part, preferred Biarritz, in the Pyrenees, and it was
owing largely to her that this resort became by far the most popular in
France, casting Dieppe, Trouville, and Boulogne completely in the shade.
Nowhere in the world could there have been found such a medley of wealth
and poverty, aristocrats and adventurers, high-born dames and
demi-mondaines of all classes, as at Biarritz in the days of the Second
Empire. It had attractions of all sorts, hotels and restaurants, shops
and bazars of every description, as well as a casino containing a
theatre, concert hall, ball and gaming rooms, from the broad terrace of
which there was a most charming view.

Opposite the town, on a rocky plateau across a narrow arm of the sea,
stood the Château Eugénie. It looked more like a barracks than a palace,
and owing to the salt spray flung all around it in time of storm, no
sort of vegetation would thrive there; but when the Empress stepped out
on her terrace in the morning, the sea lay spread out at her feet. The
ever changing lights and shades of sky and water lent variety to the
solitary landscape; while looking the other way she could watch the gay
equipages rolling by toward the baths. This to her was the ideal
combination of nature and civilization. In this beautiful spot Eugénie
spent some of her happiest hours, forgetful of the tedium of court life,
her husband’s infidelities, and the persecutions of Prince Napoleon and
his followers. Here her natural high spirits found vent, and she romped
like a child with her little son, or revelled in the sea-bathing,
feeling for the first time since her early youth the charms of a life
free from excitement or ambitious aims.

Like all the children of Spain, she had the deepest affection and
reverence for her native land, that land with which were connected so
many happy as well as painful memories, and where her mother still
lived. Now that her griefs had lost their sting, she often longed for
Spanish ways and customs and to hear once more her childhood’s tongue.
From Biarritz she could make frequent excursions into Spain, where she
hailed even the poorest peasants with delight, chatting with them in
their native language, overwhelming them with gifts, and receiving in
return so warm a welcome that it more than repaid her for all the
humiliations of her youth. She also visited Madrid, the scene of her
early adventures, and was received with the greatest distinction by
Queen Isabella, from whose court she had once been dismissed on so
slight a suspicion.

But it was not only in Spain that Eugénie won all hearts. Whether
receiving royal guests or visiting some charitable institution,
presiding at court or opening an exhibition, it could not be denied that
she had been wonderfully equipped by nature for the great role she had
been called upon to play on the world’s stage. Part of her popularity
was also due to the kindness of heart which was such a conspicuous trait
in her character through all her changes of fortune. Many admirable
institutions in Paris owe their origin to the Empress Eugénie’s
benevolence. In the Summer of 1865, while acting as Regent during the
Emperor’s stay in Algiers, she devoted herself to improving conditions
in the reform schools for children. Accompanied by a prefect of police
she made a visit in person to “La Petite Roquette,” a house of
correction. A terrible state of affairs existed in this institution,
where, since it was intended more for abandoned children than those in
need of punishment, a cell system had been introduced to prevent
communication between the two classes. The dark court was also divided
by high walls; and here the five hundred wretched inmates could be seen
creeping about their cages like wild beasts, with bowed heads and dull,
vacant faces.

The Empress’s motherly heart overflowed with pity at sight of these
children’s sufferings. She appointed a commission at once to make a
change in this dreadful system and attended all the meetings, which were
held at the Tuileries, with the greatest interest and enthusiasm. A
member of the commission took advantage of one of these meetings to
oppose the Empress’s project. “The idea is all very well, Madame,” he
declared, “but there are so many obstacles in the way of its execution
that it is difficult to see how any remedy can be provided. To discuss
the question is merely an excursion into the realm of sentiment.”

“Pardon me,” replied the Empress gently, “but this is a question of
humanity, not of politics.” And she finally carried her point. The
youthful prisoners of La Roquette were sent into the country, and the
cell system was abolished. It was not without anxiety that the warders
received the new inmates, fearing it would be a hard task to manage them
and that the well-behaved children would be corrupted by the others.
Results proved, however, that the Empress was right, for even the most
depraved and hardened culprits improved with kind treatment and work in
the open air.

Equally worthy of note was the day spent by the Regent at St. Lazare—a
place of confinement for abandoned women. News of the Empress’s visit to
this place spread like wildfire over the city, and on leaving these
poor, despised creatures she received touching proofs of the people’s
devotion to her. The crowds assembled in the streets murmured blessings
on her, while the women knelt to kiss the hem of her gown.

Toward the end of September, 1865, cholera broke out in Paris, and the
court, which was then at Biarritz, decided to return to the capital at
once. The memory of the terrible epidemic of 1849 was still fresh in the
minds of the people; and when, after apparently subsiding, the disease
broke out again with renewed violence a terrible panic ensued. The
courage and self-sacrifice displayed by Eugénie during this time won
universal applause; the newspapers, even those hostile to her, were loud
in praise of the royal “sister of charity.” On the twenty-first of
October the Emperor made a long visit to one of the cholera hospitals,
and on leaving ordered the sum of fifty thousand francs to be
distributed for the relief of the sufferers. Eugénie, to whom he had
said nothing of his intention, was much disappointed at not having
accompanied him. The next morning she drove from St. Cloud to Paris,
where she made the rounds of all the cholera hospitals herself, going
from bed to bed with words of cheer and comfort. Once, pausing beside a
man who was dying, she took his hand in hers gently and spoke some words
of sympathy to him. Thinking it one of the nuns, the poor fellow
summoned up his last remnants of strength to kiss her hand. “Thanks,
sister,” he murmured. The sister of charity who accompanied the Empress
leaned over and said:

“You mistake, my friend; it was not I, but our gracious Empress who
spoke to you.”

“Never mind, sister,” interposed Eugénie, “he could have given me no
more beautiful name—” a saying which was repeated and long remembered
among the people.

                            * * * * * * * *

Yet much as Eugénie had endeared herself to the masses by her
fearlessness and kind-heartedness during the cholera epidemic, it was
not long before the feeling against her on account of her bigotry,
extravagance, and frivolity again came to the surface, not alone in
court circles but throughout the whole Empire. To lay to the Empress’s
account all the follies and indiscretions, all the worldliness and
self-seeking, of Parisian life at that time, would be most unfair; yet
it cannot be denied that her influence had much to do with the luxury
and the eccentricities of fashion that prevailed. Doomed by her rank to
a life of idleness and inactivity, the lack of proper food for heart and
mind forced her energies to find outlet in trifles. The gratification of
her vanity became the chief object of life. With the sceptre of France,
her slender hand also grasped that of the world of fashion—a domain in
which she was no beneficent sovereign, but a tyrant whose yoke was borne
without a murmur. Even when she was a young girl her costumes excited
envy and admiration for their originality, and at every watering-place
she visited, bungling imitations of the beautiful Spaniard’s _toilettes_
were to be seen in hotels and gaming halls. In Paris her influence soon
began to be felt, and almost before her name had become familiar to the
people her waistcoats were being copied and sold by all the fashionable
tailors, and the high-heeled riding boots she had worn at Compiègne were
adopted by every French court lady. Every morning, as we have seen,
before going to mass, Eugénie devoted one or two hours at least to the
study of dress.

Her bedchamber, with its adjoining oratory, was at some distance from
her other apartments and lacked all stamp of individuality. The bed,
heavily draped with rich hangings, was raised on a dais, and resembled a
throne. In this room she kept the Golden Rose that was presented to her
by the Pope, and beside the bed stood one of the palm branches sent her
each year by the Holy Father with his blessing. Yet here she spent far
less time during the day than in the dressing-room next it, where there
were several large movable mirrors enabling her to see herself from all
points. On the floor above, connected by elevator and speaking tube with
her private apartments, were the rooms occupied by her waiting-women.
Here was a vast store of silks, velvets, and satins, with gowns and
every conceivable article of wearing apparel. Ranged along the wall were
rows of dresses and wraps of all sorts and colors, with receptacles for
hats, shoes, fans, parasols, etc. In one of the rooms were several
life-sized forms which the Empress had had made, exactly reproducing her
own figure in size and height, and dressed like living women to the
smallest detail; for in spite of the pains taken by the modistes and
tailors to win her approval, it was seldom that a costume entirely
suited her.

She was tireless in her quest for novelty. With each change of season,
quantities of models and materials were brought to her to choose from,
and numberless conferences were held with Madame Virot, the court
milliner, as well as Worth, the famous ladies’ tailor, whose reputation
she founded. He would often send her costumes costing one or two hundred
thousand francs, and once he made her pay as much as fifty thousand
francs for a simple cloak. Even these works of art met with no mercy in
their original form, but were always remodelled and altered according to
her orders, until her own carefully cultivated taste produced the
desired effect of perfect harmony. All the artistic talent she possessed
was devoted to the study of dress, and under her sway fashion rose into
the realm of art. Inseparable from the image of the beautiful Spaniard
is the energy with which for eighteen long years she wielded its
sceptre. Her greatest interest in life, it constituted at once her
strength and her weakness—weakness because from it sprang the charge of
folly and extravagance justly made by France against its former
sovereign; strength, because of the art with which it enabled her to
hold her place on the pedestal to which she had been elevated, and gave
her the power to dazzle and fascinate not only the masses but also her
equals and contemporaries.




                               Chapter X
                         Decline of the Empire


As yet there had been no sign of change in Eugénie’s fortunes. The sun
of empire was still apparently at its zenith. France deemed herself
invincible. The throne seemed secured to the present dynasty for all
time. The Emperor’s policy had received some severe blows, however, and
disquieting rumors floated over from the ill-fated Empire he had founded
in Mexico.

Maximilian and Carlotta had often visited the Tuileries in their younger
days, and it was only by Napoleon’s urgent persuasion and promise of
support until his throne should be firmly established that the Austrian
Archduke consented to accept the fatal crown. Mindful of this promise,
in his hour of need Maximilian sent his wife to Europe to seek
Napoleon’s aid. She arrived in Paris at night, and without pausing a
moment to rest after the long wearisome sea voyage she hastened to St.
Cloud, her disordered dress and distracted appearance betraying her
terrible agitation. She had brought over the letters Napoleon had
written to her husband, promising his support. Handing these to the
Emperor, she flung herself at his feet imploring him to keep his word.
But all in vain. Even had he wished, he could have done nothing; and
sobbing aloud, half senseless with despair, Carlotta is said to have
left St. Cloud with a curse on her lips, crying: “Louis Philippe’s
granddaughter should never have trusted her fate to a Bonaparte!”

But although Napoleon’s political errors began to darken the halo lent
him by the Crimean War, and although two important events in the world’s
history had occurred without his having any share in them (the wars
between Denmark and Germany in 1864, and between Prussia and Austria in
1866), to all appearances the period immediately succeeding was marked
by greater splendor and prosperity than ever. On the first of April,
1867, a second World’s Exposition was opened in Paris. Once more a
stream of people from all parts of the world poured into the capital.
Never in the history of France had such lavish hospitality been
displayed—not even during the magnificence of Louis the Fourteenth’s
time nor in the reign of Napoleon the First. A perfect galaxy of crowned
heads was assembled at the French court, and the proudest princesses,
the most conservative monarchs, vied with one another in marks of
friendship toward “the upstart” and “the adventuress.” And with what
matchless grace, with what admirable tact, Eugénie played the part of
hostess to her illustrious guests!

In consequence of an attempt to assassinate the Czar of Russia, history
has preserved an account of the grand military review that was held on
the seventh of June, 1867, in his honor and that of the King of Prussia.
Living walls of spectators surrounded the plain of Longchamps where it
took place. The glitter of uniforms, the flash of arms, and the flutter
of banners made a brilliant scene in the summer sunshine. The guests
arrived in state and took their places. The Crown Princess of Prussia
and her sister Princess Alice of Hesse were already in their seats on
the tribune, but no one heeded them. A general air of expectancy
prevailed. Suddenly on all sides arose the shout, “Here comes the
Empress!” and beaming with happiness, smiling and bowing graciously to
all, Eugénie drove round the great plain through ranks of cheering
thousands and alighted at the imperial pavilion. Directly behind her
came the three monarchs on horseback, followed by the German Crown
Prince and the Russian heir to the throne, while the massed troops
presented arms and a blare of trumpets greeted Their Majesties. Eugénie
took the seat of honor on the tribune, her glance travelling proudly
over the glittering ranks of soldiers, the flower of the French army,
and the shouting throngs beyond. As the sovereigns approached, Alexander
of Russia and William the Great of Prussia rode up and bent to kiss her
hand. The granddaughter of the wine-merchant Kirkpatrick, daughter of
Manuela Montijo of doubtful reputation, receiving public homage from
Europe’s mightiest princes—well might Eugénie be proud and happy!

The review at Longchamps was one of the last of those brilliant
spectacles that amazed the world during the Second Empire, although not
the last of Eugénie’s triumphs that memorable summer. Three weeks later
the exposition prizes were awarded by the Prince Imperial, officiating
as President, on which occasion were present the Prince of Wales, the
Crown Princess of Prussia, the Crown Prince of Italy, the Duke of Aosta,
the Grand Duchess Marie of Russia, and lastly the Sultan, with his son
and two nephews. Side by side on the magnificently decorated platform
sat Christian and Mohammedan, the bigoted Empress and the Turkish
Sultan. He had no command of French, but the glances with which he
followed her every motion plainly spoke the language of admiration.
Intoxicated with gratified vanity and ambition, Eugénie believed herself
at the summit of her greatness; but already the ground was trembling
beneath her feet. On that very day Napoleon received news of
Maximilian’s tragic fate, and the shouts of the populace were powerless
to drown the echoes of the rattle of musketry that came to him from
Querétaro like a prophecy of evil.

One of Napoleon’s most marked and singular characteristics was his firm
belief in predestination. It was this fatalism that had led him to
centre all his energies on winning the throne, and to it he also owed
his cool personal bravery. With this indifference to danger were linked
the irresolution and vacillation so conspicuous in all the political
dealings of his later years. He tried in every possible way to lift the
veil that hid the future. There was scarcely a fortune-teller of any
repute in Paris whom he did not secretly visit, and, incredible as it
may seem, their prophecies always made a deep impression on him.

It had often been foretold him, even before he ascended the throne, that
Germany would be the cause of his undoing, and that was the reason why
he could neither bring himself to support national unity in that country
nor yet decide forcibly to oppose it. He had hoped the war between
Prussia and Austria would weaken both powers so that he might be able to
snatch the roast chestnuts safely from the fire; but Prussia’s decisive
victory left him helpless and irresolute, unable to nerve himself to any
decisive action. The increasing power of that country caused a growing
uneasiness throughout France, and the Emperor’s credit began to sink. He
tried to form new political alliances, but it seemed as if the hand of
fate, which at first had led him on from victory to victory, was now
against him, for he encountered only difficulties and disappointments.
To play the role of protector to the Latin peoples had always been a
part of Napoleon the Third’s policy. It was no slight blow to him,
therefore, when Isabella of Spain, with whom he was about to form an
alliance, was dethroned just as a meeting between them had been
arranged. She sought refuge in Paris, where she was received with royal
honors, and her son, afterwards King Alfonso the Twelfth, became the
constant playmate of the Prince Imperial.

                  [Illustration: _NAPOLEON THE THIRD_]

The revolution beyond the Pyrenees sounded the alarm for France, and
clouds of insurrection began to appear on the horizon. Napoleon found
himself forced to loosen the reins of government; and although the
disturbances apparently blew over, opposition increased daily. With
modification of the press laws in 1867 the situation grew worse instead
of better; and when in the following year Henri Rochefort began the
publication of “La Lanterne,” the waves of revolution began to rise.
This democratic Comte exercised a magical influence over public opinion
in Paris, and his scurrilous journal, filled with venomous attacks on
the whole imperial family, reached an enormous circulation. Napoleon’s
political blunders were not calculated to appease popular sentiment or
his own anxious forebodings. To add to his troubles, he suffered greatly
from a chronic physical ailment; and in the autumn of 1869 his health
was so seriously affected that there was some talk of declaring the
Prince Imperial of age, before the proper time. Eugénie’s popularity too
began to wane even among the middle classes, which had always formed her
strongest support.

As every one knows, it was her cousin Ferdinand de Lesseps who was the
originator of the Suez Canal. With it his name will remain forever
linked, while the Empress’s share in this undertaking will doubtless
soon be forgotten. He conceived the idea during a long residence in
Egypt, and devoted a year of tireless labor to its execution; but it was
her enthusiastic support that encouraged and urged him on and paved the
way for his success. It was not all smooth sailing, however. Before the
canal was finished rumors arose that it would not be navigable for large
vessels. The stock fell heavily; and with their usual fickleness, the
French people, threatened with heavy losses, blamed the Empress, who had
done her best to encourage subscription to the stock. Instead of the
shouts that usually greeted her appearance she encountered only an
ominous silence; and so great was her unpopularity at this time, that
she found it advisable when at the theatre to retire to the back of her
box. Her desire to be present at the opening of the Suez Canal added
fuel to the flame. One day it was announced by telegraph from London
that Napoleon had negotiated a loan of ten million francs from English
banks to defray the expenses of his wife’s journey to Egypt. Of course
it was totally without foundation, but the radical press hastened to
spread the report with so many malicious additions that Eugénie was
universally denounced for the vast sums she was supposed to have
squandered.

Arrangements for her journey were continued, nevertheless. Preparations
were made everywhere to receive the fair guest on so grand a scale that
it is well worth a glance backward to recall the homage paid her so
short a time before her fall. Venice, where the imperial yacht, the
_Eagle_, first touched, was beautifully illuminated. The Italian royal
family welcomed her in person; and a hundred singers serenaded her on
the Grand Canal. In Athens she met with a still more flattering
reception; but it was at Constantinople that the most elaborate
preparations had been made in her honor. All the streets through which
she was to pass were newly paved and a number of houses torn down that
they might be widened. Accommodations for twenty thousand troops were
erected, and near by, a splendid kiosk. A gorgeous sedan chair valued at
over two hundred thousand francs was made expressly for her use, while
for weeks the ladies of the harem were busy practising their curtsies
and wearing high-heeled shoes. On the arrival of the _Eagle_, October
13, 1869, she was met by a fleet of twenty vessels, which escorted her
through a double line of Turkish men-of-war, twenty-five on either side,
each of which saluted with a hundred and one guns, the imperial yacht
responding with an equal number. The shores of the Bosphorus were lined
on both sides with troops. All the ships in the harbor were decorated
with flags, and at the appointed landing-place the Sultan was waiting to
receive his royal guest. The event was made a national holiday. All the
provinces and dependencies of the Turkish Empire sent deputations to the
capital to greet the French Empress; public celebrations of all kinds
were held; and at night the illuminations on the Bosphorus were a
magnificent sight.

A week later Eugénie reached Alexandria on her triumphal progress, where
she was welcomed by Ismail, the Viceroy of Egypt, and from whence the
journey was continued by rail to Cairo. Everywhere her appearance was
the signal for an unbroken succession of _fêtes_ and illuminations. At
the celebration of the opening of the Canal her yacht was the first to
pass through it. Seated on the flower-wreathed deck, amid the thunder of
cannon and strains of music from all the ships’ bands, she sailed
proudly through the new waterway, not only France’s sovereign and the
patroness of the great undertaking, but Queen of Beauty and Fashion as
well. Almost all the great sea powers were represented at the ceremony.
The Emperor of Austria and the Crown Prince of Prussia with many other
royalties were with her on the _Eagle_, but it was upon Eugénie that all
eyes were fixed; for her the frantic shouts that rent the air.




                               Chapter XI
                            The War of 1870


The spirit of revolution may be quenched at times in the populace of
Paris, but it is never entirely extinguished. Napoleon the Third had
held their turbulence in check for nearly twenty years, but now all
signs seemed to indicate that an outbreak was imminent. The Emperor’s
best friends advised him to identify himself with the liberal party,
which in case of any change of sovereignty would prove a valuable
safeguard to his young and inexperienced son. Others were of the opinion
that a war with Prussia was necessary to preserve the Empire and revive
popular loyalty to the name of Napoleon. That such a war would at one
blow shatter the proud imperial edifice, no one dreamed, least of all
the Empress, who was at the head of this party.

Napoleon chose the former course. At the general election of 1870, the
change from an autocratic to a constitutional government was approved by
about eight million votes. For the other alternative he had a decided
distaste. His watchword, “empire is peace,” was no empty phrase on his
lips, in spite of the wars into which he had been forced by policy. When
at the victorious battle of Solferino he saw whole ranks of Austrians
mowed down by his artillery, he ordered the firing to cease, in spite of
the protests of his officers; and long afterwards he could never think
or speak of this bloody engagement without a shudder. One of his most
cherished plans was to bring about a general disarmament of all the
great powers, and a presentiment that his ruin was near at hand made him
the more averse to any conflict with Prussia. The pressure in favor of
it grew steadily greater, however, and, weary of the burden of
government, ill in body and mind, he finally yielded. War was declared
on the most trivial pretext, July 14, 1870.

Heretofore the French people had shown no special interest in the
subject, and the news came as a surprise; yet once the die was cast, the
prospect of war excited the wildest enthusiasm. The Emperor and Empress
were greeted with acclamation: the horses were taken from their coach
and drawn by the youth of France; the imperial pair rode in triumph
through the streets of Paris. The whole nation was aroused. Volunteers
flocked to the banner of France. Shouts of, “To Berlin! To Berlin!” and
the strains of the Marseillaise, filled the air. The ferment that had
long been brewing having now found an outlet, the riotous element
hastened to the frontier. Every day fresh bodies of troops departed.
Paris was in high spirits, and news from the seat of war was awaited
with confident assurance. From day to day it was expected that the
Emperor would join the army; but it was not till the twenty-eighth of
July that he finally took his departure, leaving his wife as Regent
during his absence, and accompanied by the Prince Imperial, who was to
have his first experience of warfare.

When Napoleon questioned Lebœuf, the Minister of War, concerning the
preparations for war, he was assured that all was complete. The army was
ready; everything in order, to the smallest detail. Yet how far from
truth, alas, were these empty phrases! Reforms that had been begun under
the preceding ministry were far from being carried out. Army
organization was wofully defective. Even so important a post as Metz was
insufficiently protected. Contractors defrauded the Government. All was
confusion and lack of proper equipment. Under these conditions it is not
strange that the overthrow of the Germans did not speedily follow. After
some delay—far too long to suit the eager Parisians—came the first
despatch, a message of victory. The indecisive action at Saarbrücken was
construed into a glorious beginning of the war. The Emperor’s telegram
to his wife was printed all over Europe and stamped the Prince Imperial
with an impression of ridicule that only his life-blood, afterwards shed
at Itelezi, was able entirely to obliterate.

  “Louis has received his baptism of fire. He showed admirable calmness
  and did not once lose his composure. One of General Frossard’s
  divisions has taken the heights overlooking Saarbrücken on the left.
  Prussia will offer little resistance. We were at the front, with
  musket and cannon balls falling all about us. Louis has kept a bullet
  that struck close beside him. One of the soldiers wept to see him so
  brave. Our total loss amounts to one officer and ten men.

                                                             “Napoleon.”

This news was received with satisfaction but neither surprise nor
enthusiasm. It was no more than was expected, and even in France there
was much laughter over Lulu’s “baptism of fire.” But soon came a change.
The German victories of Weissenburg, Wörth, and Forbach followed in
rapid succession. At the French headquarters an attempt was made to
suppress the news of these defeats and no word from the seat of war was
received in Paris. The ministers who went to St. Cloud to consult with
the Empress found her in tears, and full of anxiety at the long silence.
At length, however, rumors of the disasters reached the capital, and the
people were beside themselves with rage and despair.

Early on the morning of Sunday, the seventh of August, the Empress came
to Paris and immediately sent for the ministers and the presidents of
the Legislative Assembly and the Senate. The next day Paris was declared
in a state of siege and a proclamation issued by the Empress, urging the
citizens to maintain order and rally to the support of France that her
losses might be retrieved. She already imagined herself at the head of
affairs, taking active measures for the defence of the capital, cheering
on the troops, and firing them with courage, a role that particularly
appealed to her fancy; but the appeal made little impression. The
people, only too familiar with her fondness for theatrical effect and
admiration, clamored for action. Declamation was little to the purpose.
They wanted victories, not comedies!

Public irritation vented itself first of all against the ministry, which
was forced to resign. Émile Ollivier was succeeded by the aged General
Montauban, Count of Palikao, who had distinguished himself in the war
against China; while Trochu was appointed Governor of Paris. Further to
satisfy popular sentiment, Napoleon was forced to resign his position as
Generalissimo in favor of Marshal Bazaine, who accordingly assumed the
chief command of the army.

Under normal conditions the Emperor’s place would now have been in
Paris; but the new ministry, as well as the Empress herself, protested
against his return. Disheartened by the long delays, sore with
disappointed hopes, and furious at the supposed mistakes of the
generals, the people of Paris were ripe for revolution, and only a spark
was needed to set them aflame. The imperial pair were overwhelmed with
scorn and abuse. Already their throne was tottering, and with the
victorious advance of the Germans, conviction of its speedy downfall
grew daily stronger.

Never before had the Empress found herself in so critical a situation.
The new ministry lacked the confidence of the public and could be of no
help to her. She had no tried general to depend upon, and every trace of
the troops’ devotion to the house of Napoleon had long since vanished.
She stood alone and defenceless against an enraged populace only
awaiting a pretext to hurl itself upon her. With this daily-increasing
excitement, the brawls and dissensions caused by the army’s defeats on
the frontier, and universal anxiety for the fate of the country, Eugénie
began to understand how grievously she had erred in urging on this
“little war,” as she had referred to it in the beginning of the
campaign. Fears as to the fate of her own husband and child made her
realize for the first time the suffering of thousands of other wives and
mothers. She felt the necessity of uniting with them in some active
work, and was tireless in her efforts to atone in some measure for the
wrong she had thoughtlessly committed.

In the days of prosperity her worst qualities had been uppermost; she
had not shown the better side of her nature. It remained for misfortune
to reveal her real strength and nobility of character. In spite of the
feeling against her, she went about everywhere, personally
superintending the care of the wounded. The brilliant salons of the
Tuileries were turned into hospital wards. A new spirit seemed to
animate her and to lend her fresh strength in this time of danger. At
night she rarely slept, and even when taking a brief rest during the
day, her attendants had orders to awaken her the moment any message or
despatch arrived. No matter how worn out or exhausted she might be, she
would force herself to rise and hasten back to the bedside of the
wounded where there was so much suffering to relieve, though she had no
time to think of her own misery. Yet often in her own chamber, haunted
by the agonized cries of the dying, she would pace up and down wringing
her hands as if in bodily pain, tortured by anguish of soul. In these
hours she prayed long and fervently for her dear ones and for her
people, the women who suffered like herself, the brave men who were
fighting for their country. A feverish activity possessed her. She tried
to persuade Austria to assist France. She wrote to the Queen of England
imploring her to intervene for the sake of peace. She pardoned over two
thousand criminals. She superintended the preparations for the defence
of Paris and held innumerable consultations with Trochu, in whom she
placed the blindest and most implicit confidence. At the same time,
however, she took the precaution of having all her important private and
family papers conveyed on board the French squadron, as well as some of
the principal works of art from the Louvre. She also had a list of the
crown jewels made, to secure her against suspicion in case of extremity.
Her own personal ornaments were sent to her mother in Spain. The strain
and over-exertion of these weeks seriously affected her health and
wrought a startling change in her appearance. Tortured with suspense,
she waited from day to day for news from the seat of war; yet all that
came brought so little comfort that her advisers thought best to conceal
it from the people as far as possible.

At length came the final blow. On the afternoon of the third of
September, as the Minister of Foreign Affairs was on his way to the
Tuileries, he was met by the Superintendent of Telegraphs.

“I have just received a most important telegram for the Empress from the
Emperor,” he said. “I usually attend myself to the messages that pass
between Their Majesties, but this one I have not the courage to
deliver.” It was the well-known despatch:

  “The army is defeated and has surrendered. I myself am a prisoner.

                                                             “Napoleon.”

The Minister went at once to Eugénie with this terrible news, the
reality of which exceeded all that her darkest fears had painted, and
her feelings at this moment may be better imagined than described. Yet
even then she did not consider her own fate. Her only thought was for
France; and she firmly refused to employ the troops in her own defence
against the people, for that would have added the terrors of civil
strife to those of war. Late that evening the bad news reached the city,
but instead of uniting to make a brave stand against the enemy, the
populace rose in arms, and it was plain that the Empire’s days were
numbered. The streets were filled with surging throngs, shouting “Down
with the Emperor! Down with the Empress! Long live the Republic!” On all
sides was heard the expression, “An Emperor dies, but does not
surrender.”

About one o’clock that night the Legislature held a special session. Not
a member was absent, and the galleries were crowded. Amid a deathly
silence the president arose. He said:

“A calamity has brought us together here at this unwonted hour. I have
called the session to discuss our present situation.”

Not a sound broke the stillness. All eyes were fixed on the Ministers’
bench. Count Palikao rose. The aged hero was no orator, but his voice
was firm as he announced the disaster of Sedan. He added, slowly:

“With such news it is impossible for the ministry to enter into any
discussion before to-morrow. I was called from my bed only a short time
since, to come here.”

The president of the Exchequer then put the question as to whether the
meeting should be adjourned. “Aye-aye,” shouted several voices. Suddenly
a bushy head arose, and a loud, discordant voice made three
motions:—“Deposition of the Emperor; Appointment of a provisional
Government; Retention of Trochu as Governor of Paris.” It was Jules
Favre.

Only members of the Extreme Left subscribed to these motions, which were
received with surprising indifference. One member of the Right protested
against the Emperor’s deposition, but an ominous silence greeted his
words. For the rest of the night a similar silence reigned throughout
the city. It was the hush before the storm.

That Eugénie was far from suspecting an uprising is shown by the fact
that she made absolutely no preparations for flight. The next morning
she arose early, heard mass in her private chapel, and made her rounds
of the hospitals as usual. At nine o’clock she received General Trochu,
who, although only a few hours since placed at the head of the new
Government, still solemnly protested his loyalty to her. Later in the
forenoon a deputation waited on the Regent to inform her of the
appointment of a commission to assume control of the Government in her
place, in other words, to request her resignation. She listened quietly
to their explanation and dismissed them with the following words:

“What you mean to offer me, gentlemen, is the pledge of a peaceful
future, on condition that I renounce the present and abandon in time of
danger the post entrusted to me. That I cannot do. To such terms I
certainly will not subscribe. Go back to the Assembly and say to General
Palikao and his colleagues that I rely upon them implicitly; that I
grant them full power to take any steps proper for the interest of the
country, and approve the same in advance.”

Meanwhile the public tumult increased in violence. The red flag was
hoisted everywhere. A boy of nine years even climbed up and fastened one
to the top of the bronze railing that surrounded the Tuileries.
Thousands filled the Place de la Concorde, roaring the Marseillaise at
the top of their voices. The Assembly had again met, but so many forced
their way into the chamber, and the uproar was so great, that it was
impossible to transact any business.

“Not here shall the Republic be proclaimed,” shouted Gambetta, “but at
the Hôtel de Ville!”

This suggestion met with great applause, and the deputies adjourned to
that edifice, where a Government of National Defence was formed. The
news that the Empire no longer existed quickly spread and was hailed
with wildest enthusiasm. Not a voice was raised in behalf of the fallen
dynasty. Vast throngs invaded the Hôtel de Ville and valuable portraits
of the Emperor and Empress were hacked with knives, trampled under foot,
and tossed out of the windows. The imperial emblems were torn to pieces,
and the eagle, which could not be easily removed, was covered with
paper.

“At the windows of the huge barracks filled with troops supposed to be
loyal unto death to the Emperor,” says an eye-witness, “I saw soldiers
laughing, waving their handkerchiefs, and shouting ‘Long live the
Republic!’ Strangers hugged and kissed one another for joy. In the
neighborhood of the Pont Neuf, people mounted on high ladders were busy
pulling down busts of the Emperor, which were carried in mock state and
flung into the Seine, shouts of laughter and applause greeting the
splash with which the mutilated images of their former sovereign struck
the water.”




                              Chapter XII
                      Eugénie’s Flight to England


The Empress mean while was still at the Tuileries. One of the palace
prefects had returned from the Assembly with news of what had passed,
but she refused to desert her post even though the mob was already at
the gates of the palace and a dull roar penetrated the deserted halls.
Eugénie’s question as to whether it would be possible to defend the
Tuileries without bloodshed was answered in the negative by the governor
of the palace, General Mellinet, and she still refused to have a drop of
blood shed in her behalf. Nearer and nearer sounded the uproar, and the
trampling of feet was now distinctly audible. Shouts were heard: “She
will escape!” “Long live the Republic!” “Down with the Spaniard!”
“Forward! Into the palace—forward!”

Prince Metternich and the Italian ambassador, Count Nigra, who had
hastened to the side of the Empress, urged her to flee, as every moment
that passed made escape more difficult. But to run away from danger was
foreign to Eugénie’s nature, and she could not bring herself to believe
it necessary, in spite of the raging mob without trampling on one
another, swaying now forward, now back, striving with shrieks and blows
to make room and force open the gates of the palace, all animated by a
single impulse—hatred for the imperial house. At length sounds of tumult
were heard on the great staircase, and the Empress’s attendants implored
her to leave the palace and not expose their lives to danger.

“Is there no other way?” she asked in despair. “Is there nothing we can
do to defend ourselves? At least, you can say I have done my duty to the
last.”

Deeply moved, they kissed her hand without replying; but the Prince
urged them to hurry, as there was no time to lose. A dark cloak was
thrown around the Empress, and, accompanied by her reader, Madame
Lebreton, with the two ambassadors, Minister Chevreau, and a few members
of her court, she consented at last to go. Escape was impossible through
the palace courtyard; for the Place du Carrousel, from which it was
separated only by a slender railing, was packed with people. Some other
way must be found; but before leaving her rooms Eugénie went to the
window and stood looking down for a moment on the seething mass below.

“Alas!” she cried, “what folly to spend their strength in this way, when
the enemy is at the gates!” Then, as she turned to go, she added with
emotion:

“Unhappy palace! fate seems to have ordained that all crowned heads
shall leave you in this way.”

By this time her escort was reduced to the two ambassadors and Madame
Lebreton. The others had already fled to seek their own safety. She took
Count Nigra’s arm, and Madame Lebreton followed with Prince Metternich.
Through the Flora Pavilion of the Tuileries they hurried to the Louvre,
the galleries of which they must traverse at full length to reach an
exit on the side toward St. Germain. But here, too, the street was
crowded with people shouting, “Long live the Republic!” “Down with the
Emperor!”

The little party halted before the door, but behind them also sounded
the roar of the mob. To turn back would be inevitably to fall into their
hands. The risk must be taken; there was nothing to do but go on. Even
at this critical point the Empress’s courage did not forsake her;
indeed, she had never given clearer proof of it than now.

“You are holding my arm,” she said to Nigra; “do you feel it tremble?”

“Not in the least, Madame,” replied the Count.

The gentlemen opened the doors. The ladies passed out, and Eugénie found
herself face to face with the populace who were inflamed with hatred
against her. She was within a hair’s-breadth of sharing the fate of
Marie Antoinette, or perhaps being torn to pieces by the rabble. The
excitement was so great, there is no knowing what terrible scene might
have been enacted had she been recognized.

Luckily a closed carriage happened to be standing near by, and with
great presence of mind she rushed toward it. A street urchin spied her
and shouted, “Look, look! the Empress!” but no one heeded the words.
Nigra stopped and spoke to the boy to divert his attention while Eugénie
threw herself into the carriage, followed by Madame Lebreton. Prince
Metternich shouted an imaginary address to the driver, and off they
went, safe at least for the time being. But their troubles were not yet
ended. In her haste, Eugénie had forgotten her purse; and when her
companion drew hers from her pocket she found to her horror that it
contained only three francs in all, scarcely enough to pay for the
carriage. To avoid a discussion with the driver, they determined to
continue on foot, but whither, they had not yet considered. At the
Boulevard Haussmann, therefore, they alighted, and while Madame Lebreton
paid the coachman, Eugénie stepped into the shadow of a doorway.

It is said that the Empress knocked in vain at many doors before she
succeeded in finding a temporary asylum in her own capital; but at
length the happy thought occurred to her of applying to Dr. Evans, a
well-known American dentist whom she had known for years and often
received at the Tuileries. Arrived at his office, she had to wait with
other patients in the anteroom till her turn came; but at last Madame
Lebreton was able to gain admittance to the dentist and told him that
the Empress was without, hoping to find a refuge under his roof until
she could make her escape from Paris.

Evans’s astonishment was beyond words. Unaware as yet of the sudden
change in affairs, he could not believe it possible that the Empress
should have cause to fear for her safety. Nevertheless he begged the
ladies to wait while he went out into the street to convince himself of
the true condition of things. In a short time he returned, convinced
that they had not left the Tuileries a moment too soon; and without a
thought of his own danger or the possible detriment to his business, he
promised to aid them to the full extent of his power. His wife was away
at the time, and as luck would have it, he was expecting the arrival
that day of two patients who were unknown to his servants. He now
introduced the Empress and Madame Lebreton as these persons. His own
bedchamber was prepared for Eugénie and an improvised couch placed in it
for her companion.

While the Empress was thus being harbored in the house of the chivalrous
American, and full of anxiety as to what the morrow would bring forth,
all Paris was mad with joy. Men, women, and children marched up and down
the streets all night, singing and shouting, oblivious of the disaster
of Sedan and the country’s danger, and rejoicing that the Empire was no
more.

Evans, meanwhile, had instantly set to work. Under pretext of a
professional visit, but in reality to prepare for the Empress’s escape,
he drove out that very day to the Neuilly Bridge where he was stopped
and asked to give his name, also his destination and his errand. One of
the guards who happened to know him, however, called to his comrade to
let the American pass.

“I may be frequently obliged to pass the barriers,” remarked the Doctor
coolly; “look well at me, my man, so that you will know me again and
that I may not be detained unnecessarily.”

His plan was already made. On his return he informed the ladies that
they would be able to pass the Neuilly Bridge the next day under his
protection if Her Majesty would consent to play the part of a mad woman.
He would pretend to have a patient with him on her way to an asylum
beyond Neuilly, while Madame Lebreton could pass as her attendant.
Accompanied by a friend and countryman of Dr. Evans, who was taken into
their confidence, they started off the next morning. All went well. The
sentry at once recognized the doctor, while the Empress, leaning back in
the carriage, her face hidden by a thick veil, passed unnoticed. This
danger past, they reached St. Germain in safety, and then Nantes, where
they put up at an inn.

“I have a lady with me whom I am taking to a private asylum,” Evans
explained to the innkeeper, “and I would like a quiet room with shutters
on the windows.”

His request was complied with without question, and here Eugénie and her
companion were able to enjoy a few hours’ rest. Evans’s colleague
returned to Paris with the doctor’s carriage which they had used thus
far, and a coach was hired for them by the landlord to convey the
invalid to the institution where she was to be left in charge. Further
to carry out the plan, it was privately arranged that the Empress should
appear to protest against being taken there, and make such forcible
resistance on the way that they would apparently be forced to take
another road. They had driven for scarcely half an hour, therefore, when
a loud dispute arose between Eugénie and the doctor, which became so
violent that Evans called to the coachman to stop that he might try and
induce the patient to go a short distance on foot.

“I will not—I will not!” stormed the Empress, and her screams frightened
the horses so that the driver declared he would go no further unless the
disturbance was stopped.

“I will never go to that place, I will not!” shrieked Eugénie afresh,
and at last there seemed nothing for it but to turn back and drive to
the nearest post station, whence the coach was sent back. As a further
measure of precaution they changed conveyances at every station, now,
however, taking the road to their real destination—the watering-place of
Deauville, where Mrs. Evans was then staying.

For many weeks, as we have seen, Eugénie had lived in constant agitation
and anxiety—the days full of exhausting labor, the nights without
sleep—and had suffered both mentally and physically in consequence. She
was no longer able to eat, and had lived for the last four or five days
literally on nothing but black coffee and chloral, which she had been in
the habit of taking in large quantities to drown her troubles. She wept
almost incessantly; and even when sleep lent her a few moments’ respite,
she would start up suddenly, begin to talk and laugh excitedly, then as
quickly burst into tears and relapse again into deepest melancholy.

After two seemingly endless days, the fugitives reached Deauville on the
evening of September 6, and Evans took the Empress and her companion at
once to his wife. Mrs. Evans was about the same size as Eugénie, and
gladly packed up a part of her wardrobe with some necessary articles of
toilet for the Empress’s use, while the doctor hastened to discover what
boats were leaving for England. Two vessels were in the harbor, the
larger an American ship, the other a pleasure yacht, the _Gazelle_,
belonging to Lord Burgoyne. Finding the former not sufficiently
seaworthy, Evans applied to Lord Burgoyne, who at first flatly refused
to take the Empress across, partly for political reasons, partly because
a storm was brewing. But Eugénie’s protector insisted so urgently that
he finally yielded on condition that the ladies should not come aboard
till just before the boat sailed, lest the fact that he had passengers
should attract attention. Shortly before midnight Eugénie, accompanied
by Evans and her faithful Lebreton, hurried on board the yacht, which
did not weigh anchor, however, till the next morning.

The dangers by land now lay behind the fugitives, but others still
awaited them by sea. Soon a fearful storm arose, and the little craft
was tossed about at the mercy of the elements. The crew, little
suspecting that an Empress looked to them for rescue, labored on bravely
and calmly, as is the way of sailors, who know at any moment they may be
called into eternity. Still the storm increased in violence, and the
danger grew greater every moment. The ladies were flung about the tiny
cabin like bales of merchandise. By nightfall all hope seemed vanished.
Pale as death, terror stamped on every line of his countenance, Lord
Burgoyne appeared at the door of the cabin, crying that they were lost.

“It is all your fault!” he shouted, glaring wildly at the doctor, then
rushed away as suddenly as he had come. The three passengers looked at
one another in amazement, and seasick, exhausted, and disheartened as
she was, Eugénie could not help laughing at the Englishman’s frenzy of
terror. Still the brave little _Gazelle_ struggled on against wind and
wave until at last the storm began to subside, and about three o’clock
the next morning, after what seemed a miraculous escape, they reached
the harbor of Ryde on the Isle of Wight.

With what feelings must the ex-Empress have once more beheld this coast!
Must she not involuntarily have recalled that first visit with her
mother to England so long ago, in her joyous care-free youth? And again,
when she took that first important step toward recognition by the
European sovereigns, and as the favorite of fortune, gay, courted, and
admired, landed amid the enthusiastic shouts of the people, as the
honored guest of Queen Victoria? To-day she turned to England for
refuge—no longer the beautiful sovereign of a great European power, but
a wretched fugitive, an unhappy woman exhausted with fatigue and faint
for lack of food. Those shores on which she had once been hailed with
triumph now in the gray dawn were sole witnesses of her mute despair.




                              Chapter XIII
                          The Empress in Exile


Early on the morning of the eighth of September, the landlord of the
Hotel York in Ryde was awakened by a loud knocking, and found a man and
two women standing outside the door. They had gone first to another inn,
but had been refused admittance, their appearance was so bedraggled and
forlorn. Yet worn and travel-stained as they were, the doors of the York
were opened to them without hesitation, and here the Empress and her
companions were able to rest for a few hours after their exhausting
journey. That same afternoon, however, they went on to Brighton, where
the Empress heard that the Prince Imperial had escaped through Belgium
and landed at Dover the preceding day. Through all her own danger and
distress she had been tortured by constant suspense as to the fate of
her son. Now, therefore, she hurried at once to Hastings where she hoped
to meet him; and that day witnessed the reunion of mother and child. But
how different, alas, was this meeting from that of which Eugénie had
dreamed, when the Prince—hailed with cheers from the troops and the
people, and followed by a mother’s proud hopes—had departed “à Berlin”
under his father’s care!

There could have been no greater contrast than that of the life that now
began for Eugénie in Hastings, with her brilliant career as Empress, or
even with that troubled war-time and the dangers and excitements through
which she had passed. Torn by alternations of hope, fear, and
disappointment, she had scarcely had time during the past month to think
of herself, much less give way to her feelings. Here, at the Marine
Hotel, for the first time she found leisure to look back on what had
happened and to review her past life—that inevitable time of reckoning
from which no life is wholly free. Hitherto she had known nothing but
gratified desires, glittering triumphs, and realized ambitions. She had
had no cause to distrust friends or doubt their loyalty, no experience
of ingratitude. Rarely forgetful of a service done her, and incapable of
falsehood herself, she had preserved an almost childlike faith in human
nature. Now, for the first time, fate was to make her thoroughly
familiar with this bitterest chapter in the book of experience. Scarcely
had she turned her back on the Tuileries before her own servants rifled
her apartments. Later, when news came that the rabble had broken into
the palace and wrought havoc there, Eugénie’s first thought was “Poor
Trochu!”

“Why do you pity him?” asked her companion, in surprise.

“Because he has sworn so often to me that only over his dead body should
any assailant enter my palace, that I feel sure he must be dead,” was
the reply.

That this General, who so basely deserted his sovereign in the hour of
danger, was on the contrary quite well and enjoying life in his
self-appointed position as head of the Government is only a single
instance of how those who in time of prosperity bowed lowest before the
Empress were the first to desert her in misfortune. Every newspaper that
she saw showed her the meaning of adversity. Those who had received the
most signal marks of favor were the loudest now to denounce the
defenceless woman. With petty spite, the Government of National Defence
had destroyed all the emblems of imperialism and done everything in its
power to represent the dynasty, which for nearly twenty years had upheld
the welfare and prosperity of France, as a curse to the country. Anxious
to discover, if possible, something derogatory to the character of the
Empress, it had caused the palace to be searched for any private papers
she might have left behind, but without success. Even the few letters
that were published for the purpose of exposing her disclosed nothing in
the least compromising.

Her jewels and dresses, with some ready money that was found in the
Tuileries after her flight, were sent to her in England. Yet although
she was forced to dispose of her diamonds to defray necessary expenses;
and although Napoleon, to provide himself with funds, sold his private
estate in Rome, the “Palazzo dei Cesari,” for a few hundred thousand
francs, it was persistently asserted in Paris that the imperial family
were in possession of millions of francs with which they had enriched
themselves at the people’s expense; also that Napoleon had made enormous
sums in foreign speculation and owned capital in Dutch, English, and
American bonds.

Filled with anger and despair at these lies and petty persecutions,
Eugénie found life at Hastings unendurable. The prying curiosity of the
townspeople and of the crowds of strangers that flocked thither was a
torment to her. Even the sea air she so loved did her no good; the
magnificent view only served to rouse bitter memories of the happy days
at Biarritz. The King of Prussia had offered her and her son a residence
in Wilhelmshöhe, but she would accept no hospitality from France’s
enemy. At length, through Dr. Evans, she rented Camden House at
Chiselhurst, whither she moved toward the end of September.

But even though dethroned and an exile, Eugénie did not altogether cease
to concern herself with politics. While she was at Hastings, and the
situation following her flight was so new as still to warrant
recognition of her authority as Regent, Bismarck sent an envoy to her to
discuss terms of peace. She replied that so long as there remained a
single enemy on French soil, or there was question of even the smallest
cession of territory, she would enter into no negotiations with him.

Bismarck was not the only one who tried to induce her to intervene in
this matter. There was still one post in France that held out against
the Germans, still one general at least who was loyal to the Empire.
Marshal Bazaine was in Metz with a force of 170,000 men, all picked
troops, including the Imperial guard which had so often filled the
Parisian populace with pride at state reviews. Believing himself strong
enough to exert some influence over the question of peace or a
continuation of hostilities, he sent General Bourbaki to Chiselhurst,
with the consent of the King of Prussia, to inform the Empress that he
was in favor of concluding peace if she would so authorize him. Tempting
as this opportunity of again wielding power was to Eugénie’s active
nature, she prudently forbore, realizing that her best plan was to
withdraw entirely from the field of politics at present and await a more
favorable opportunity, when she might work with redoubled energy for the
restoration of her family. This course was also in accordance with the
wishes of Napoleon, to whom she made a secret visit in October in order
to consult with him, while General Bourbaki was at Chiselhurst awaiting
an answer.

In spite of Eugénie’s continued refusal to mix in any public affairs,
the “salon at Chiselhurst” was persistently reported to be the centre of
political intrigue; and Prince Jerome Napoleon, who in the absence of
the Emperor wished to appear as head of the imperial family, presented
himself at Camden House one day to demand of the Empress an explanation.
A stormy scene followed between these two bitter enemies, and the “red
Prince” was careful that a properly distorted account of the interview
should be made public.

After an imprisonment of about seven months, Napoleon was at last free
to return to his wife and son at the little home in Chiselhurst, where
the imperial family continued to live in the simplest manner; for
although Camden House did not lack comfort and even elegance, it was so
limited as to space that it was impossible to accommodate more than one
or two guests at a time. Yet the joys of family life compensated in a
measure for all the luxury and state of which they had been deprived by
fortune, and in this smaller sphere Eugénie lost none of the dignity and
charm of manner for which she had been so conspicuous. It was the more
easy for her to adapt herself to these new conditions as gradually a
circle of their old friends began to gather about the exiles, and
expressions of loyalty and devotion arrived nearly every day from
France, with many proofs of friendship from Queen Victoria and other
royalties.

A great task still lay before her—to provide for the future of her son.
She had always been a wise as well as devoted mother, and had not failed
to impress on the young Prince that more would be required of him than
of others, in order properly to fit himself for the high position he
would one day be called upon to occupy. Now that the throne must be won
back again, it was doubly important that he should receive a thorough
military education. This son was now her only thought. She centred in
him all her hopes and expectations, for the Emperor’s health—which had
been poor for years—was now rapidly failing. She could never count on
Napoleon the Third’s return to the throne; but as the mother of Napoleon
the Fourth she saw herself in fancy once again in France, more highly
honored, even prouder and happier if possible, than before.

The chronic ailment from which the Emperor had always suffered
threatened, toward the close of 1872, to take a fatal turn and his
physicians advised an operation. Personally, Napoleon was strongly
opposed to it; but the Empress, not realizing the danger, and perhaps
with the secret hope that it might enable her husband to become once
more a power in French politics, urged him to yield to the physician’s
advice. He submitted accordingly to the operation, but had not strength
enough to recover from the shock; and on the ninth of January, 1873, the
“dreamer” passed quietly away without a word or a sign.




                              Chapter XIV
                        Death of Prince Imperial


Eugénie’s grief at her husband’s death was deep and sincere. Over his
bier she wept far bitterer tears than those she had shed during those
dreadful days following her flight from the capital. Indeed she was so
prostrated as to be unable to appear at the funeral. Human nature is
elastic, however, and it was never the Empress’s way to fold her hands
and brood over her troubles. She found one source of consolation,
moreover, in the constant proofs of attachment that reached her, not
only from the friends that had remained faithful to her through all the
changes of fortune, but also from many others who had long seemed to
have forgotten their vows of allegiance.

As death had removed all possibility of the restoration of Napoleon the
Third to the throne, his old adherents rallied to the support of his
son; and as there was still a large Bonapartist party in France, it
seemed not improbable that with the exercise of courage and patience the
Empire might one day be revived. In 1873, by uniting with the
Legitimists and Orleanists, they succeeded in deposing Thiers, who had
been President of the Republic since 1871, and electing Marshal MacMahon
in his place, a change greatly to the advantage of the Bonapartists, who
now entered the political arena once more as a regular party.

In the Autumn of 1872 the Prince Imperial entered the military academy
at Woolwich, where he studied hard and made gratifying progress; and on
the death of his father he was generally recognized as heir to the
imperial throne, in spite of all the efforts made by his cousin Napoleon
to prevent it. Eugénie now lived only in this son and his future; no
stone was left unturned to smooth his pathway to the throne. As yet he
had a hard struggle before him; but her faith in his ultimate victory
was supreme; and supported by ex-Minister Rouher, the leader of the
Bonapartists, then as ever one of Eugénie’s stanchest friends, she
carefully but firmly gathered up the threads by which she hoped to guide
the course of events.

On the seventh of February, 1875, the Prince passed the required
examinations and left Woolwich with an officer’s commission. He had
developed greatly in every respect, to his mother’s joy and the pride of
his party, whose hopes were now fixed on him. His amiability and charm
of manner won him friends wherever he went. Unlike his father, he
objected strongly to any radical measures or political agitation of any
sort, and hoped to recover what he considered his rightful crown by the
natural allegiance of France. Besides her political ambitions for her
son, Eugénie was anxious also to arrange a suitable marriage for him;
but in this she was disappointed. The wooing of Napoleon the Fourth met
with the same fate as that of his father. There were repeated rumors of
a betrothal between him and Queen Victoria’s youngest daughter,
Beatrice, who is said to have cherished a warmer feeling than friendship
for the exiled Prince; but, deep as was the sympathy felt for him by the
English royal house, and true a friend as Victoria had proved herself,
to entrust her daughter’s fate to young Napoleon seemed to her a trifle
too uncertain. When this plan failed, Eugénie fixed her hopes on the
Princess Thyra of Denmark; and in 1878 the Prince made a visit to that
country to try his fortune with the Danish court; but here, too, he was
rejected as a suitor.

The Bonapartists now felt that to have any serious hope of gaining the
French crown the Prince must first win his laurels as a soldier; they
urged him, therefore, to join the English army, which was about to go to
war with the Kaffirs of Zulu. Much as she desired to see her son seated
on the throne, Eugénie shrank from this method of achieving it; but the
Prince fell in at once with the suggestion, and unmoved by his mother’s
attempts to dissuade him, sailed for Africa with the English troops,
leaving a message of farewell to his followers.

On the ninth of April, 1879, he arrived at the headquarters of the
commander-in-chief, Lord Chelmsford, and took part in several actions
with great spirit and courage. In May, while he was on a reconnoitring
expedition in the neighborhood of Itelezi with a fellow officer and
several men, the party was suddenly surprised by a band of Zulus who
sprang out from behind an ambuscade. Abandoned by his companions, who
fled to save themselves, the Prince held out bravely as long as he
could, but at length one of the savages dealt him a fatal blow, and he
fell, his body pierced with seventeen spears. The _Military Gazette_, in
which the young Prince received honorable mention, says:

  “Thus did an inscrutable fate grant to him what it cruelly denied both
  his father and the great founder of their race—to fall in battle,
  bravely fighting against the foe.”

The death of the Prince Imperial created the profoundest sensation. As
soon as the news reached England, Colonel Sidney, an old friend of the
family, was sent to break it to the Empress, but before he could get to
Chiselhurst she had already heard of it. That morning all newspapers and
telegrams had been carefully withheld from her, but her letters were
overlooked. One of these was doubly addressed, to her and to Secretary
Pietri, and contained an allusion to “the dreadful news” without
mentioning what it was. She sent at once for the Duke of Bassano to ask
for an explanation; and when he arrived speechless with emotion, she
suspected that it concerned the Prince. Chilled with fear at what she
read in his countenance, she stood as if turned to stone. That son, for
whom she longed day and night, her only joy in life! The thought was so
terrible, Eugénie could not pursue it to the end.

“Something has happened to my son,” she groaned; “I must start at once
for the Cape.”

Unable to reply, the Duke went out into the hall, where he met Colonel
Sidney, who brought confirmation of the sad tidings. The Empress sent
again for the Duke and insisted upon hearing all, repeating that she
should go to Africa at once.

“Alas! madame,” said the Duke, “it is too late.”

“Oh, my son—my poor son!” shrieked the mother, and fell senseless to the
floor.

After the first paroxysm of grief was over, she neither wept nor spoke,
but listened with feverish despair while the Duke related all the
circumstances of her son’s death, not withholding a single painful
detail. Madame Lebreton then led her gently into her bedchamber where
the Abbé Goddard tried to comfort her. But the religion that had been
such a source of support to her through all her troubles now proved of
little consolation. Her whole life had been bound up in her child, and
now that this last earthly support had crumbled, all hope and joy lay
buried in the dust. For several days and nights she neither ate nor
slept, but remained sunk in a sort of torpor from which she roused only
to ask in tones of agonized pleading if it might not be that her son was
only ill or wounded, and she could go out to nurse him back to health.
Fortunately for her life or reason, she at last found relief in tears,
and now she wept unceasingly.

The whole world shared the stricken mother’s sorrow, and thousands of
messages of sympathy were received at Chiselhurst. Telegrams of
condolence came from all the courts of Europe, as well as from President
Grévy of the French Republic, Marshal MacMahon, and many others. Requiem
masses were held in every Roman Catholic church in London. Especial
sympathy was felt for her in Spain, but the consolation of weeping out
her grief on a mother’s bosom was denied her, as the Countess Montijo
was then so old and feeble it was thought best not to inform her of her
grandson’s death.

Republican, not to say radical, as the French capital was at that time,
the death of the Prince Imperial caused general consternation. The
Empire was still fresh in the minds of all. At the birth of the
Emperor’s son innumerable prayers had been offered for both mother and
child. Step by step the affections of the gay Parisians followed the
little Prince, and when at the age of three he rode with his mother to
Notre Dame to the thanksgiving services for the victory of Solferino,
the state coach was scarcely able to make its way through the admiring
and enthusiastic throngs. Since that day the Napoleonic dynasty had
suffered many reverses. The Empress, once the pride and glory of her
subjects, was an exile, surrounded by only a few friends, and living in
comparative poverty. Now she had suffered the last and heaviest blow of
fate in the loss of her only child. Yet many more hearts went out to
Eugénie in this hour of trial than in the days of her prosperity. Great
and small, rich and poor, friend and foe, united in heart felt sympathy
for the grief-stricken mother. But it was a grief that was beyond
consolation. She had done with life. “All is finished,” were the words
she constantly repeated, and sobbing aloud would bury her face in her
hands to shut out the awful vision that was always before her—the body
of her son pierced with cruel spear-wounds.

                            * * * * * * * *

When the remains of the Prince Imperial, which had been sent back to
England under a military escort, were borne into the hall at Camden
House by some of his former comrades at Woolwich, a single cry of
anguish escaped the Empress, but she did not shed a tear. All night she
remained on her knees in prayer beside the coffin; at dawn, when the
flame of the wax tapers began to pale in the growing light, she heard
mass, after which she shut herself closely in her own room and did not
leave it again till after the funeral services were over.

The burial of Napoleon the Third had been only the usual drama enacted
in every family when a beloved one is laid to his last rest, but that of
the Prince Imperial was a scene that touched even the coldest and most
indifferent, and excited world-wide interest. At the Emperor’s death,
despite their grief, the mourners had looked with hope and confidence
toward his son; now this last hope had vanished, and tears were seen
even on the cheeks of grizzled veterans. Where hundreds had accompanied
the father’s remains to their resting-place, the son’s bier was followed
by thousands of every rank and station.

Early in the morning of the day of the funeral, July 12, Queen Victoria
arrived at Camden House with her daughters Alice and Beatrice, and with
her own hands laid a laurel wreath of gold upon the coffin. Many other
royal and distinguished personages followed, and the expression of
genuine sorrow visible on every face lent an air of remarkable solemnity
to the occasion. The Archbishop of Southwark performed the burial rites
for which some of the most famous opera singers had proffered their
services. Those of Madame Caters and Christine Nilsson were accepted;
but the latter, some of whose happiest memories were associated with the
palmy days of the Empire, and who had then considered it her highest
honor to sing before the now broken-hearted Empress, was for the first
time unequal to her task. Her voice failed, and she burst into tears.

                            * * * * * * * *

Broken by mental and physical suffering, the ex-Empress Eugénie still
lives on, awaiting the moment of release that shall reunite her with
those dearest to her on earth. She made a pilgrimage to Zululand to see
the spot where her son met his death. She has frequented various
watering-places seeking relief from the physical infirmities from which
she suffers. She visits many hospitals and charitable institutions to
minister to the sick and wounded; yet these acts of mercy serve only to
revive her sorrows, and emphasize the void in her lonely life.

From Chiselhurst, which held so many painful memories, she moved to
Farnborough, whither she also had the bodies of the Emperor and the
Prince Imperial conveyed. With the Queen of England Eugénie enjoyed the
same close friendship as in earlier years, and until the time of
Victoria’s death she was a frequent visitor at Windsor, although she
never appeared at any Court festivities. She still receives frequent
proofs of loyalty from France, and every year on her birthday she is
overwhelmed with flowers and good wishes. Yet nothing can rouse her from
her melancholy. Whole days and nights she sits brooding over the past,
haunted by faces and presentiments of death. At one time her attendants
even found it necessary to remove all the portraits of her husband and
son in order to preserve her reason.

A sad change has also taken place in her appearance. Portraits of her in
the early days of her widowhood show a still attractive figure whose
unhappy fate is suggested only by her mourning and the lines about the
eyes. But years such as she has since experienced count heavily. Her
hair is now snowy white. The slender figure is bowed with age and grief.
Scarce a trace is left of her wonderful charm and fascination, and in
the pale mourner with sunken eyes and faltering step there is no longer
the faintest resemblance to the once beautiful and splendor-loving
Empress.

                  [Illustration: _THE EMPRESS-WIDOW_]

What a contrast, alas! between her youth and her age! In the one, a
triumphant goddess, soaring from victory to victory, a sovereign tried
by many disappointments and disillusionments indeed, yet never
disheartened, never harboring bitterness or resentment in her heart: in
the other, a broken and grief-stricken woman, weighed down with sorrows
for which time brings no consolation, and whose thoughts are ever with
her beloved dead.

The historian of the future, undazzled by the glittering splendor of the
Second Empire, and unbiassed by sympathy for the unfortunate widow and
mother, will scarcely judge the Empress Eugénie as leniently as the
critic of to-day, yet more fairly than those of her own realm who have
tried to blacken her reputation by calumny. He will find palliation for
her faults, not so much because they were the result of her origin and
training as because they were more than counterbalanced by her better
qualities, especially her warm-heartedness and dauntless courage. He
will also recognize that, as the wife of a usurper, she was beset with
complications to which a born princess would not have been exposed, and
that, taking all things into consideration, she filled that difficult
position with credit to herself and France.

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
