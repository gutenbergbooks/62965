<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>In a recent interview at her villa in the Riviera,
the ex-Empress Eug&eacute;nie is reported to have
said: &ldquo;I have lived; I have been; I do not ask
more. I ask not to be remembered. Between my
past and my present there exists not half a century,
but ten centuries. Men have changed, times have
changed. It is a dream that is dissipated.&rdquo; It is
a fascinating story, as told in these pages, the career
of this granddaughter of a Scotch wine-merchant,
who by the power of her personal charm, the incentive
of her ambition, and the boldness of her resolution,
achieved her purpose, though stigmatized an
upstart and adventuress, and eventually driven
from the throne and doomed to spend her remaining
days brooding over the loss of her power and
her beauty; over France&rsquo;s crushing defeat in what
the short-sighted Empress lightly termed &ldquo;my war&rdquo;;
over her folly in urging Napoleon into the war;
sorrowing over his death, and chiefly, lamenting the
death of her son at the hands of Zulu savages in
that far-away land whither she had urged him to
go. Hers is an adventurous, a romantic, in every
way an extraordinary, life-story. It shows what one
of determined will and fixed purpose may do. But
was it worth the doing? In these days, looking
back over her career, all she can say is: &ldquo;I am the
past. I am the distant horizon where exists a mirage,
a shadow, a phantom, a living sorrow. I am an old
woman, poor in everything that makes a woman
rich. My husband, my son&mdash;that brave boy&mdash;they
are gone. My eyes no longer turn to the future.
I live only in my youth. There is nothing for me
but to wait. My dreary winter is nearly over.&rdquo;
Poor Eug&eacute;nie! That she still clings to the hope of
seeing a descendant of Napoleon on the throne of
France is evidenced by a letter to an old soldier who
recently appealed to her for help, in which she says:
&ldquo;As her majesty admits that every old soldier of
the empire has remained faithful to the sacred cause,
to the imperial eagles, it is necessary so that her
majesty may be assured of a devotion of which she&mdash;or
rather the legitimate heir to the throne&mdash;will
perhaps have need sooner than one thinks, that she
receives from you a letter in which she will find the
expression of your unshakable devotion to the
memory of Napoleon III and to the Imperial cause,
as well as the expression of your mistrust of the
present regime.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c1"><span class="h2line1">Chapter I</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Youth of Eug&eacute;nie</span></h2>
<p>At the beginning of the last century there
dwelt in the city of Malaga in Spain a
merchant named Kirkpatrick. Although
descended from a Scotch family of distinction that
had been forced by the fall of the Stuarts to flee
their native land, this later scion of the race earned
his livelihood by the sale of wines which he dispensed
with his own hand in a room at the rear of his shop.
The business prospered and he became a rich man,
exporting large quantities of Spanish wines to foreign
countries; but he still kept his wine-room in
Malaga, assisted by his four daughters, who did
much to attract custom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>The lofty family traditions of the Kirkpatricks of
Closeburn could scarcely have been expected to be
remembered amid the practical duties of the merchant&rsquo;s
busy life, but his beautiful daughters were
by no means unaware of their high descent nor
without hope of elevating themselves once more to
the rank of their ancestors. Of the four sisters,
Manuela, the third, was the most aspiring as well
as the most beautiful. Even when busy serving
wine and chatting gayly with the gentlemen who
frequented her father&rsquo;s wine-room, her mind was
constantly dwelling on the traditions of her house,
and in the glories of the past she forgot the sordid
surroundings of the present. Although a true
daughter of the soil from which she sprang, Manuela
was very different from the ordinary Spanish girl,
who is often indolent and ignorant; for with her
Scotch blood she inherited the energy without which
her dreams and ambitions could never have been
realized. Determined to rise in the world, and with
nothing but herself and her beauty to depend upon,
she decided that only a brilliant marriage could
accomplish her ends; and to achieve this she was
ready to use any means or make any sacrifice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>Among the officers stationed at that time in Malaga,
most of whom were frequent patrons of Kirkpatrick&rsquo;s
wine-room, was a colonel of artillery in
the Spanish army, Count Manuel Fernandez de
Teba. No longer young, and far from attractive
in person, having lost an eye, and being very short-sighted
besides, he was little fitted to awaken tender
sentiments in the fair sex; but Manuela was not to
be daunted by this. His heart seemed a citadel
not too difficult of conquest, and without regard to
his appearance she devoted herself to the study of
his antecedents. The result of these genealogical
researches exceeded her fondest hopes, for they
proved that the bluest blood of Spain flowed in
Count Teba&rsquo;s veins. He was descended from the
noble Genoese family of Porto-Carrero, which, emigrating
to Estremadura in the fourteenth century,
had secured by marriage the right to bear some of
the most illustrious names of Spain as well as the
heirship to the joint estates of Teba, Banos, and
Mora. He was the second son, it is true, but his
elder brother was unmarried; and if she united her
future with his, the ambitious maiden could reckon
with some security on attaining in time the rank
and position to which she aspired.</p>
<p>Her father&rsquo;s increasing prosperity, no less than
her own remarkable beauty, caused many younger
and handsomer suitors to lay their homage at Manuela&rsquo;s
feet, but however favored any one of these
may have believed himself, he was now cast remorselessly
aside. Her course once decided on, she lost
not a moment in setting her hand to the work. She
showed Count Teba the most delicate attentions,
the most flattering deference; for him were reserved
her sweetest smiles, her tenderest glances, until at
last the credulous nobleman&rsquo;s admiration kindled
into passion, and without even consulting his family,
Manuel Fernandez, afterwards Count de Montijo
and Duke de Peneranda, married Maria Manuela,
daughter of the wine-merchant Kirkpatrick. The
young Countess at once set up an establishment on
the grandest scale. Her salons became the resort
of the richest and most distinguished officers, and
she charmed every one with her hospitality, her
beauty, and her wit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>While she was enjoying her triumph to the full,
however, evil tongues were soon busy over the free
and easy tone said to prevail in the home of the
worthy pair&mdash;a rumor that quickly found its way
to the Count de Montijo. From the first he had
strongly disapproved of his brother&rsquo;s unsuitable
marriage, and, indignant at the gossip caused by
his sister-in-law&rsquo;s behavior, he determined to prevent
their becoming his heirs, by making a marriage
himself in his old age. Manuela was seized with
fury at this news; but prudence soon gained the
upper hand, and instead of sulkily avoiding her new
relatives she made every effort to win their approval,
a course that was the less difficult for her to pursue,
as, to her secret joy, the marriage remained childless.
Tired of living in her native place where she was
constantly reminded of her humble origin, she finally
persuaded her husband to leave Malaga; and with
their little daughter Francisca Theresa they moved
to Granada, where the Count&rsquo;s brother had his residence.
There, on the fifth of May, 1826, the future
Empress of the French, Maria Eug&eacute;nie, was born&mdash;the
same day of the same month on which Napoleon
the Great had died.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>Eug&eacute;nie&rsquo;s mother was a perfect woman of the
world. Brilliant and clever and mistress of the art
of conversation, she far surpassed the ordinary
Spanish woman in intellect as well as wit. It was
not strange, therefore, that with all these charms at
her command she had succeeded in winning over
her brother-in-law and sister-in-law, and establishing
herself in their favor; so that Count Teba&rsquo;s
family soon became welcome guests at all the Montijo
entertainments, where they were received with
the utmost courtesy and respect. But even this
did not satisfy Manuela. She longed for a life of
more freedom and unrestraint, and to climb yet
higher in the ranks of society. Her ambition was
destined to be fulfilled, for before many years had
passed Count Teba stood beside the bier of his childless
brother; and his wife now persuaded him to
take up his residence in Madrid.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>The domestic life of Eug&eacute;nie&rsquo;s parents had never
been a harmonious one. Her mother&rsquo;s extravagance
and coquetry, together with the jealous and violent
temper of her father, soon banished the genius
of peace from the household; and their quarrels
were the more frequent and bitter from the Countess&rsquo;s
lack of any real affection for her husband. Matters
grew even worse after their arrival in the capital,
for Manuela gave herself up entirely to intrigues and
made her husband&rsquo;s life miserable. Here, too, she
was prompted less by passion than by ambition,
since it was through her connection with influential
persons that she hoped to obtain a position at court.
Among the many she attracted to her house was General
Narvaez, at that time the most powerful man
in Spain. At his intercession, the wine-merchant&rsquo;s
daughter was made first lady-in-waiting to the
youthful Queen Isabella. This coveted post she
could no doubt have easily retained had she not
allowed her passions for once to gain the upper hand.
A young Italian for whom she had a fondness disappeared
one fine day with all her jewels; and on
this occasion she so far overstepped the bounds permissible
even at the Spanish court that it was intimated
to her she would do well to leave Madrid.</p>
<p>While their mother was thus coquetting and intriguing
at court, Eug&eacute;nie and her sister, two years
older than herself, had been left at the Sacred Heart
Convent in Paris. The Countess now took the two
girls away with her, and, leaving her husband in
Madrid, began a pleasant life of travel, dividing her
time between London, Paris, and the fashionable
watering-places, everywhere gathering about her a
circle of friends and adorers, many of them men
distinguished in the world of art and learning,&mdash;although
the greater part of her admirers belonged
to that class which lives in enjoyment of the present,
preferring the pleasures of the senses to those of the
mind. Over her young daughters&rsquo; acquaintances
and associates, however, she kept a close watch;
whatever her own indiscretions may have been
during this period, she carefully guarded their innocence
from all evil influences. She neglected no
opportunities for improving their minds, and it was
then that the foundations were laid of that excellent
education which no one ever ventured to deny the
Empress Eug&eacute;nie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>It was impossible for the careful mother not to
perceive the attention excited wherever they went
by her younger daughter&rsquo;s beauty, her regular
features, exquisite coloring, large clear eyes, and
wonderful golden hair; and while she little dreamed
that Eug&eacute;nie was destined to become the sovereign
of a great European nation, with justifiable maternal
pride she began to hope that her child might rise
to even greater rank than she herself had attained.
To pave the way to this good fortune, the Countess
Montijo made another attempt to regain her position
at court, but met with a prompt refusal. Narvaez,
however, who was still in power, took her under
his protection without more ado; and on the death
of her husband, in 1839, she determined to return
to Madrid, where, at the expiration of her period
of mourning, the handsome widow accordingly appeared,
accompanied by her still more lovely daughters,
Francisca, at that time seventeen years old, and
Eug&eacute;nie, fifteen. The sisters were a complete contrast
to each other though equally beautiful. The elder was
darker and more slender, and her features were softer
than Eug&eacute;nie&rsquo;s, though her face had less character.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>Through the zeal and influence of Narvaez and
their mother&rsquo;s prudence and perseverance, the Queen
was finally induced to take the young girls into her
court, but their position there was by no means an
enviable one. As daughters of a woman who in
spite of her personal attractions was well known to
have led an irregular life, they were looked upon
with general suspicion; and as they constantly
appeared with this mother in society, it was only
natural that members of their own sex should hold
aloof from them, while the men redoubled their
attentions in consequence. The Countess Montijo
was shrewd enough to see that she must proceed
with caution if she wished her plans realized; therefore,
to protect her daughters from the reefs on
which her own reputation had been wrecked, she
kept all undesirable cavaliers at a respectful distance.
Among all those who sought the young Countesses&rsquo;
favor there was only one she considered worthy to
occupy the position of her son-in-law, the Duke of
Berwick and Alva; him she encouraged in every way,
permitting him to ride and drive with her daughters
and accompany them to the theatre, giving him an
intimate footing in the family. His companionship
was a source of delight to both sisters, and he soon
became the centre of their thoughts, possessing as he
did the art of making himself so agreeable to both that
each one fancied herself the object of his preference.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>Eug&eacute;nie adored Alva with all the intensity of a
first love, endowing him with all the loftiest and
most noble qualities; and, worshipping this image
created by her fancy, believed herself loved in return.
The mother, however, more experienced in the faithlessness
of man, began to suspect that he had no
intention of choosing either daughter as a companion
for life; accordingly she set before him, when he
came one day to call, the serious alternative of
declaring himself or severing all intercourse with
the family; to which ultimatum the Duke replied
by requesting the hand of the elder. When Francisca,
radiant with joy, hastened to her sister&rsquo;s room
to announce the great news she found her in bed.
At first she thought her asleep, but on coming closer
discovered to her horror that Eug&eacute;nie&rsquo;s eyes were
fixed and staring, her forehead covered with beads
of moisture, her features drawn and convulsed&mdash;she
had taken poison! Francisca&rsquo;s screams of distress
quickly brought her mother and the maid to
the scene. A physician was summoned, and Eug&eacute;nie
was restored to consciousness. A long and serious illness
followed. In her delirious ravings she betrayed
the fact that, hidden behind a door, she had overheard
the Duke&rsquo;s avowal and in despair had tried
to end her life. Her recovery was slow and tedious.
Even after she had been pronounced out of danger,
her nervous system showed traces of the shock in a
slight trembling, a nervous quiver of the eyelids,
that never entirely left her. The sudden attacks of
depression, the fits of weeping that sometimes seized
her in after years, even in the midst of some festivity,
may also be ascribed to the effects of the poison taken
in her youth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>Still deeper were the traces left on the young girl&rsquo;s
character by this unhappy experience. Though
taught by pride to conquer her love for the husband
of her sister, she was forced to be a daily witness of
that sister&rsquo;s happiness and to endure the pity with
which she was universally regarded, added to which
was the galling conviction that the Duke himself
suspected her secret. The once shy and modest
maiden became a bold, forward coquette, striving
to forget her sufferings in a whirl of pleasure and
amusement, craving admiration, ambitious and frivolous.
As a child she had always preferred boys&rsquo;
sports to the usual occupations of girls, and excelled
in riding, swimming, and fencing. Now she might
be seen any afternoon galloping bareback through
the streets of Madrid, smoking a cigar or a cigarette.
She devised all sorts of fanciful costumes that only
she could wear, often appearing in the Andalusian
national dress. She was a frequent visitor at the
theatre and all public places of amusement, and had
a passion for bull-fights. One of the toreadors, for
whom she embroidered a splendid cloak, was her
declared lover. She rarely missed one of these gory
festivals; and, seated on the lowest tier among the
most enthusiastic spectators, in her Andalusian costume,
she was always the centre of attraction. The
womanly modesty that had made Eug&eacute;nie so charming
in her early girlhood had vanished, but she was
even more beautiful and fascinating. She was surrounded
by admirers, and encouraged the addresses
of dukes and princes till her coquetries aroused the
jealousy of the Queen. But no one paid court to
her seriously. Suitors were naturally shy of choosing
a wife who often appeared in masculine attire,
who wore the most startling and conspicuous bathing
costumes to excite admiration while in the water,
and whose hand was as familiar with riding-whip
and stiletto as with fan or bouquet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>In spite of her many extravagances, however,
Eug&eacute;nie&rsquo;s youth was marked by a gay thoughtlessness
and daring that were most attractive. Her
self-reliant nature could brook no restraint. She
scorned prudence and yielded rashly to every impulse.
The attention she attracted could not fail
to furnish food for gossip, and malicious tongues
were soon busy with her reputation&mdash;a fact which
did not deter her in the least from pursuing her
fondness for adventure. This indifference to public
opinion also led her, unfortunately, to defy custom
and snap her fingers at the strict etiquette prescribed
at court. At last she went out alone one
evening with one of the young pages for a long walk.
Whispers of this romantic promenade soon reached
the ears of Queen Isabella, who, though setting the
worst possible example herself in regard to morals,
insisted on the strictest propriety in the behavior
of her ladies; and both culprits were summarily dismissed
from her service.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>Like all Spanish girls, Eug&eacute;nie had been brought
up from her earliest years a devout Catholic, with
the deepest reverence for the Pope and the Roman
religion, a devotion that in time became almost
fanaticism and furnished her enemies with a weapon
of attack against which she was powerless to defend
herself. After her dismissal from court she began
to reflect on the difference between a religious life
and one of idle pleasure. While at the convent, the
contrast between the unselfish devotion of the nuns
and the atmosphere of her parents&rsquo; disordered household
made a deep impression on the young girl&rsquo;s
mind, and the Church seemed a blissful refuge from
the storms of life. Now&mdash;feeling more and more
conscious of the void within her&mdash;a passion for
religion seized her, a longing to escape from the
world of lies and slander in which she lived, into a
purer atmosphere, a new field of activity. The
Church held out its arms to her, and in them she
determined to seek relief and to find strength to
devote her life to the poor and suffering. It is said
that when Eug&eacute;nie went to the convent prepared
to take the vows, an old half-witted nun approached,
gazed at her with dull, vacant eyes, and suddenly
exclaimed, &ldquo;My daughter, do not seek shelter behind
our walls. You are destined to adorn a throne!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In her state of religious ecstasy these words could
not fail to impress Eug&eacute;nie deeply. It seemed a
voice from heaven, speaking to her through the nun
and consecrating her to the world. The Countess
Montijo, too, did all she could to strengthen her
daughter in this conviction, and persuaded her at
length, instead of burying herself in a cloister, to
travel abroad with her again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">Chapter II</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Eug&eacute;nie&rsquo;s Marriage to Louis Napoleon</span></h2>
<p>As a child, Eug&eacute;nie was seldom seen without a
knot of violets in her hair or in her belt;
and when the scorching summer sun of
Spain made these blossoms scarce, a shepherd boy
was commissioned to bring them to her from the
heights of the Sierra Nevada. Even when older, she
still wore her favorite flowers on all occasions, for a
gipsy had foretold that her fortune &ldquo;would flourish
with the violet.&rdquo; So on that memorable evening
toward the end of the thirties, when at a Spanish
watering-place Napoleon and Eug&eacute;nie (she, then,
almost a child) saw each other for the first time, she
wore a wreath of violets in her hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall never forget,&rdquo; said an eye-witness of the
scene, &ldquo;the way in which the Prince gazed at the
young Countess when she was presented to him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>The acquaintance was renewed some years later
during a winter residence in London (1847-48), and
it was only natural that these two, brought together
by chance, should be attracted to one another. Both
were of noble rank; both had a longing for fame and
splendor; both were unfaltering in the pursuit of
their ambitions; both were rich in hopes, yet poor in
worldly possessions; and though full of courage and
faith in the future, both were in reality adventurers.
They were soon on terms of intimacy, and Louis
Napoleon could no doubt have won the hand of
Eug&eacute;nie at that time. But his future was still uncertain.
He was poor and heavily in debt, with
the reputation of leading a dissipated life; and although
she returned his love, she was prudent
enough to renounce for the time being the opportunity
of becoming a princess. Convinced that her
lover&rsquo;s aspiring dreams would be realized, however,
and wishing to have a claim on his gratitude as
well as his affections, she wrote him as follows, on
their parting:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to go to Paris to begin the struggle for
power; to become consul, president, dictator. But
suppose these goals are attained, will you stop there?
Will that satisfy your ambition? Without a doubt
you will aim yet higher, and then how troublesome
you would find a wife! An Emperor must keep the
place beside him for an Empress. Should your
plans fail, on the other hand, should France not
offer what you expect, then and only then, come
back to me and I will give you an answer to your
proposal. Do not forget there is one heart ready
to recompense you for any troubles&mdash;for all disappointed
hopes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>On the news of the Revolution of February and
Louis Philippe&rsquo;s flight, Napoleon hastened to Paris.
At the first election for a constitutional National
Assembly (April, 1848) his cause met with little
support. Not until the supplementary election did
the Prince&rsquo;s adherents appear as a party, but once
in the field they spared no pains to win the victory.
Bonapartist proclamations were distributed throughout
Paris; and in the course of eight days no less than
six of the principal organs of the press came out for
him openly. Results showed the progress made by
the party even in this short time, for the Prince was
chosen representative of the capital of France; and
similar faith was shown in him by three other Departments.
His election aroused long and heated debates
in the National Assembly, and his friends
began to fear for his safety if he remained in Paris.
Returning to London, therefore, he sent a letter to
the legislature, stating that in consideration of the
hostile attitude toward him taken by the executive
power, he felt it his duty to renounce an honor it
believed him to have won by fraud.</p>
<p>This politic withdrawal, together with the unceasing
efforts of his friends, served to influence public
opinion still more in his favor. At the new election
following the June uprising the people of Paris chose
Napoleon for the second time as their representative,
and after an exile of thirty years, he hastened back
to the capital to take his place in the Assembly,
from which a few months later (December 20) he
was elevated to the Presidency of the Republic.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>About the time of Napoleon&rsquo;s departure Eug&eacute;nie
and her mother also left London, spending that
summer at Spa and the following winter in Brussels,
surrounded as usual by a swarm of admirers. But
all this time, while the Prince was swiftly and surely
approaching the throne of France, Eug&eacute;nie&rsquo;s eyes
were firmly fixed on Paris. With eager gaze she
watched the rising of Napoleon&rsquo;s star, and shortly
before the Empire was proclaimed, the Spanish
Countesses appeared in the capital. At last Louis
Napoleon was made Emperor. More than eight
million Frenchmen had voted for the restoration of
the dynasty, and on the first of December, 1852,
the Senate, the legislative body, and the Council of
State paid him homage at St. Cloud. Although
formally assuming the title for the first time on this
occasion, he had in reality ruled as absolute sovereign
since the <i>Coup d&rsquo;&Eacute;tat</i> (December 2-5, 1851).
His entry into Paris as Emperor, amid the thunder
of cannon, the pealing of trumpets, and the shouts
of the multitude, was merely the crowning of a
work shrewdly planned and cleverly executed, denounced
by his enemies as a crime and glorified by
his friends as a heroic achievement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>The magnificent entertainments given by the
Prince-President in the &Eacute;lys&eacute;e Palace, and the yet
more splendid ones that followed at the Tuileries after
he became Emperor, had been presided over with
tact and grace by his cousin Mathilde, daughter of
the ex-King of Westphalia. Fifteen or sixteen years
before, during a visit which Mathilde de Montfort
had paid to Arenenberg, the residence of Queen Hortense,
there had been some talk of a marriage between
her and Louis Napoleon. Hortense, who
loved her niece with all a mother&rsquo;s tenderness, had
looked forward with joy to a union so suitable in
every respect, and it had been agreed upon in a
family council of Bonapartes. But the Prince&rsquo;s
first premature attempt to secure his uncle&rsquo;s throne
put an end to the plan, and Mathilde was married,
in 1841, to the millionaire Prince of San Donato,
Anatole Demidoff. After a few years of childless
and unhappy marriage they separated, the Princess
retiring to a villa near Paris, whence she was summoned
to the capital by her cousin when he became
President. The youthful lovers had each led a
stormy life since their last meeting, and the romantic
attachment that had drawn them together at
Arenenberg had long since evaporated. In its
place a firm and quiet friendship had arisen, and
for the second time Napoleon thought seriously of
marrying his cousin. It was the dearest wish of all
the Bonapartes; but again fate intervened, this time
by the Church&rsquo;s refusal to annul the Princess&rsquo;s marriage
with Demidoff. The Prince-President found
himself forced therefore to seek elsewhere for a bride.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>He sued in vain for the hand of a Russian Princess,
and was refused in turn by a sister of the King of
Spain, and the Portuguese Duchess of Braganza.
However alluring may have been the chance of
becoming sovereign of France, these princesses had
little desire to trust their fate in the hands of an
adventurer. Well-meaning friends next drew his
attention to the poor but beautiful Carola de Wasa, a
cousin of King Gustavus the Fourth of Sweden,
afterwards Queen of Saxony. An envoy was sent
to negotiate preliminaries, and her family requested
time for consideration; but the Princess, who was
most unfavorably impressed with Napoleon&rsquo;s portrait,
protested with tears against the proposed
marriage. Beside himself at these repeated rebuffs,
the Prince swore to win the daughter of some royal
house if forced to do it sword-in-hand, and continued
in his quest. Through his friend Lord Malmesbury,
he urged Queen Victoria to arrange an alliance between
himself and her cousin, Princess Adelaide;
and though some objections were raised by the
Queen and Prince Consort, the matter was still
under consideration when, on January 19, 1853, the
world was amazed by the following paragraph which
appeared in <i>La Patrie</i>, the semi-official organ of
Paris, and was copied without comment in all the
other journals:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;According to reliable report, a happy event, calculated
to strengthen His Majesty&rsquo;s Government and ensure the
future of his dynasty, is soon to take place. It is said
that the Emperor is about to be married to Mlle. de
Montijo de Teba. Official announcement of the approaching
marriage will be made to the Legislature on Thursday,
the twenty-second of January. The Countess belongs to
one of the noblest families of Spain. She is a sister of
the Duchess of Alva and is noted for her wit and cleverness,
as well as her remarkable beauty.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>Needless to say, Eug&eacute;nie had gone to Paris solely
for the purpose of meeting Napoleon, and after her
arrival she had waited patiently for an opportunity
of obtaining access to him. Introduced by Rothschild
and his daughter, and accompanied by the
Spanish Prince Camerata, she finally made her appearance
in the court circle for the first time at
Compi&egrave;gne in 1852. It was at one of the hunts
given by the Prince-President; and the grace and
skill with which she managed her fiery Andalusian
excited the admiration of all present. Napoleon
himself was completely fascinated. Their former
meetings at once recurred to him with a rush of
youthful memories, and for the rest of the day he
scarcely left her side. Nor did it end here; after
the court had returned to Paris the Countess and
her mother were never permitted to miss an entertainment
at the Tuileries or the &Eacute;lys&eacute;e.</p>
<p>The flattering attentions paid to Mlle. Montijo
by the sovereign could not remain long unnoticed
or unremarked. It was now merely a question of
improving the moment. No opportunity for bringing
herself to his notice or of displaying her
charms to the best advantage was neglected, and
far outshining, as she did, all the women of Napoleon&rsquo;s
circle at that time, Eug&eacute;nie soon succeeded
in arousing his old passion for her. His warm
and ardent devotion was such a contrast to his usual
calm self-possession that the whole court was astonished,
although no one dreamed that the affair would
end in marriage. It is doubtful whether the Emperor
himself had any such idea in the beginning, having
resolved in his days of poverty and exile to wed none
but a royal princess. He only went so far as to intimate
to Eug&eacute;nie that he would esteem himself happy
in being her lover.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>But she was no longer the innocent girl of sixteen,
cherishing a romantic passion for an Alva and deeming
no sacrifice too great for her love. Genuine as
her affection doubtless was for Louis Napoleon, she
would make no sacrifices without gaining something
in return. At the height of his power and fame the
man who had brought about a revolution and made
himself sole ruler of France by his shrewdness and
resolution seemed in her eyes the ideal of manly
courage and heroism; yet none the less, the hot-blooded
Andalusian showed herself in this case as
cold as ice. Her experience of life had taught her
that denial was the surest means of stimulating a
passion. The Emperor was not easily caught, however.
He despatched a confidential friend to the
Countess de Montijo, not to ask for her daughter&rsquo;s
hand, but to make it clear to the shrewd woman of
the world that Eug&eacute;nie could not count on being
Empress. Reasons of state prevented his placing
the crown on the head of his beloved, although such
an event might not be an impossibility should he
be free to follow his desires in the future. But the
Countess, like her daughter, being well aware of
the surest means of attaining her end, made short
work of the Emperor&rsquo;s envoy. Repeated attempts
at persuasion proved equally fruitless, and Eug&eacute;nie
finally sent Napoleon, with her respectful greetings,
the message: &ldquo;C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s wife should be above suspicion.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>Goaded on by this reserve, the Emperor could no
longer restrain himself, and the Countess&rsquo;s persistent
refusals furnished him a welcome excuse for
broaching the plan of a marriage with her. It met
with violent opposition from all his relatives and
friends, who did all in their power to dissuade him
from it, imploring him to choose, in default of a
royal princess, at least some French lady of rank or
lineage known to the people. To divert him from
his purpose a marriage was proposed with the Polish
Princess Czartoryska. But completely absorbed by
his passion for Eug&eacute;nie their opposition only served
to fan the flame, and at last, to end the painful subject,
he asked one of his court ladies, the Princess
Lieven, whether he should choose the Princess Czartoryska
or Mlle. de Montijo. To which she cleverly
replied, &ldquo;If you leave it to me, Sire, I prefer the
Cachucha to the Mazurka&rdquo;&mdash;an answer which
Napoleon accepted as the voice of fate. At the
earliest opportunity he sent a formal request to the
Countess Montijo for the hand of her daughter, and
was of course welcomed by both with open arms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>The news of the betrothal excited endless wonder
but little satisfaction. There was almost a panic in
the Bourse, that political barometer, and the Emperor&rsquo;s
intimate friends and family went about with
gloomy faces. The proposed marriage was openly
opposed in the ministerial council and regarded with
great disfavor by the general public; in short, only
three persons were really pleased&mdash;Eug&eacute;nie, her
mother, and Napoleon. As for the first, her wildest
hopes were at last to be realized. From doubtful
obscurity she was to rise to loftiest heights. Providence
had chosen her for this position and she bowed
to its decree. The week that intervened between
the betrothal and the wedding ceremonies slipped
by in an intoxication of happiness. She was greeted
on all sides with respect and adulation, and overwhelmed
with protestations of devotion from the
courtiers. The proudest nobles of France paid homage
to her. Her enemies were silent, while Napoleon&rsquo;s
friends who had been most bitterly opposed
to the match now fawned upon her, greedy for favors
from their future Empress.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>The civil marriage was celebrated quietly on the
twenty-ninth of January; but the magnificence of
the religious ceremony exceeded anything that had
been seen in France since the days of the great
Napoleon. From early morning a double row of
troops lined the way from the Tuileries to Notre
Dame. All Paris was on the alert to catch at least
a glimpse of the spectacle. The railroads brought
more than two hundred thousand people into the
capital from the provinces, and a motley throng
filled the streets, richly decorated with flags and
banners bearing the names of Napoleon and Eug&eacute;nie,
and gay with the light <i>toilettes</i> of the ladies, and the
gold embroidered uniforms of the soldiers glittering
in the sun. Although midwinter, the sky was clear
and the air mild as spring. About half-past eleven,
Eug&eacute;nie started from the &Eacute;lys&eacute;e for the Tuileries.
Her mother was seated beside her, and opposite
them the master of ceremonies, Count Tascher de
la Pagerie. The natural beauty of the bride was
enhanced still more by the magnificent gown she
wore, a gift from the city of Li&eacute;ge. It was of white
velvet with an overdress of costly lace woven in a
pattern of violets. A jewelled girdle encircled the
waist, and on her head was the diamond coronet
worn by Marie Louise on her wedding day, attached
to which were the lace veil and a wreath of orange
blossoms. As the prospective Empress entered the
gates of the Tuileries, Prince Napoleon and the
Princess Mathilde appeared at the foot of the staircase
to receive her, while trumpets sounded and the
troops presented arms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>Precisely at noon a salute of a hundred and one
guns from the H&ocirc;tel des Invalides proclaimed that
Their Majesties were entering their coach. A huge
vestibule had been erected in front of the Cathedral,
adorned with paintings representing the saints and
olden kings and queens of France. The church
was brilliantly illuminated with thousands of wax
tapers; and as the imperial pair emerged from the
vestibule, the trumpets again sounded, all the bells
of Paris rang out, the organ pealed, and the whole
assembly arose while the Archbishop of Paris advanced
and stood before Their Majesties. At the
lower end of the church was a platform occupied
by five hundred musicians, and everywhere a mass
of gilding and floral decoration met the eye. Curtains
embroidered with golden bees covered the great
windows. From the galleries fell velvet hangings
bearing the name of the Empress in raised embroidery.
In the nave of the church stood the
throne; above it, supported by a huge golden eagle,
a canopy of red velvet bordered with ermine. The
transepts, in which the highest dignitaries of the
Empire were seated, were lined with superb paintings,
and from the ceiling hung banners bearing the
names of the principal cities of France. The court
officials stationed themselves on one side, the ministers
and deputies on the other, as the imperial pair
took their places under the canopy surrounded by
princes, princesses, ladies, and cavaliers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>About one o&rsquo;clock the ceremony began. It was
performed by the Archbishop of Paris. The Archbishop
of Versailles spread a silver bridal veil over
Their Majesties, who sank on their knees; and at
the conclusion of the ceremony, during the singing of
the <i>Te Deum</i>, Abb&eacute; Legran handed to them the
imperial marriage contract. Shrouded in costly lace
and sparkling with jewels, a glittering coronet upon
her head, Eug&eacute;nie passed out of the Cathedral, leaning
on the arm of the Emperor and preceded by the
archbishops and all the clergy. She had reached the
summit of all her hopes. The world lay at her feet.
Yet at this supreme moment it was less a feeling of
gratified ambition that filled her bosom than one of
humility and anxiety at the burden of responsibility
laid upon her shoulders. At the zenith of her fortunes,
surrounded by pomp and splendor, and greeted
by the cheers of the populace, she was suddenly seized
with a foreboding of her coming fate. It may have
been owing to her overtaxed nerves or the excitement
of these new experiences, but as she came out
of the Cathedral she seemed to see the features of
Marie Antoinette among the crowd. Wherever she
looked this face rose up before her, and with a sinking
of the heart she began to realize that all this coveted
splendor might be indeed a heavy burden.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">Chapter III</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Eug&eacute;nie&rsquo;s Personality</span></h2>
<p>After the wedding a glowing account of the
ceremony was published in the <i>Moniteur</i>,
which concluded as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The interest displayed by the people in their new sovereign
was prompted by more than idle curiosity. The
universal admiration she excited was genuine. Those
noble features, enhanced by their expression of sweetness
and modesty, irresistibly attracted the working classes,
who felt that the Empress regarded them with kindness
and good-will.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This assertion was not groundless, for although
public opinion, as we have seen, had been against
the Emperor&rsquo;s choice, and although among the cheering
throngs that greeted the sovereigns there was
much secret dissatisfaction, the spell of Eug&eacute;nie&rsquo;s
beauty and charm of manner was so potent that
even her enemies were silenced by it. The lovely
face with its regular delicate features suggests in
contour the portraits of Mary Stuart. Her complexion
was dazzling and her brown hair full of
golden gleams. Under the heavy lashes and delicately
pencilled eyebrows, her blue eyes, so dark as
almost to seem black, were full of fire and softness,
reflecting the tender heart and dauntless soul within.
The Andalusians are famous for the beauty of their
hands and feet, and Eug&eacute;nie&rsquo;s did not belie her
origin. The lines of her figure and the curves of her
neck were as perfect as those of an antique statue;
in short, hers was a flawless exterior in which no discord
marred the complete harmony of the picture.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>Thus elevated to a throne, Eug&eacute;nie burned with
desire to make herself beloved by the people, to
excite the admiration of those about her, and silence
all hints as to her birth and checkered past. Controlling
her naturally impulsive and passionate nature
when necessary, concealing her pride and ambition
under a modest, almost humble air, she left nothing
undone to add to her popularity and strengthen her
position. Two qualities invaluable to a sovereign
she naturally possessed&mdash;magnanimity and an open
hand. Before the wedding the official journals had
brought many proofs of her kindness of heart to the
knowledge of the public&mdash;such as, that the Empress,
having beheld an accident to a poor workman who
fell from a scaffold, sprang from her coach to hasten
to the aid of the unfortunate man and had him
carried to a hospital; and on another occasion, seeing
a poor abandoned child wandering in the street, the
Emperor&rsquo;s bride had taken it into her own carriage
and promised to provide for its future. Still another
and striking instance of this was her refusal to accept
a diamond necklace valued at six hundred thousand
francs which the Municipal Council of Paris had
intended to present to her. She wrote a most gracious
letter conveying her thanks to the Council for
their loyal intention, but declaring she could not
consent that Paris should make so great a sacrifice
in her behalf, or that the Emperor&rsquo;s wedding should
lay any more burdens on the country; adding that
her sole desire was to share with the Emperor the
affections of the people, and expressing a wish that
the six hundred thousand francs might be devoted
to charity. This could not fail to create a good impression;
and after the wedding many other examples
of the same kind occurred. She gave freely to all
who approached her with petitions, conscious only
that help was needed; and many kind and consoling
words accompanied the large sums she privately
bestowed. Indeed, in 1863 she went so far as to
insure her life in favor of the poor that they might
not suffer by her death; and she laid the foundations
of many noble works of charity that will cause her
name to be honored long after she herself is forgotten.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>Besides her generosity Eug&eacute;nie possessed a thousand
ways of attracting and winning people to her.
The Emperor&rsquo;s love had raised her to the throne; it
depended solely on herself and her tact to maintain
her position on it. With her inborn dignity, her
beauty, and her queenly grace, she was as well
equipped by nature for the part as any royal princess;
indeed many a sovereign born might well have
envied her, as, sparkling with jewels, she stood beneath
the canopy of the throne to receive the foreign
diplomats and nobles of the Empire. When she
appeared on horseback beside the Emperor at grand
reviews, or rode through the city in the imperial
coach, bowing in response to the shouts of the
dazzled crowds, nothing could have been more beautiful.
It was plain to all that the Empress well
knew how to play her part.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>Seldom have two persons better suited to one
another than Napoleon and Eug&eacute;nie, or more completely
in accord, been united. In all the pomp and
power of her sovereignty she never forgot that it
was to him she owed it all; and in proportion as the
sense of her own importance rose, her love and admiration
for him increased also. In the eyes of the
world he had taken a step downward in his choice
of a bride; it was now her task to prove that &ldquo;the
adventuress&rdquo; could be as useful to the dynasty as
a consort born in the purple.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would rather be spoken ill of than not be spoken
of at all!&rdquo; Louis Napoleon had exclaimed when
his first attempts to bring about a political revolution
had only excited pity and derision. Even
at that time he had studied the French people well,
and knew their weak spot was vanity. To flatter
the national vanity therefore became one of his principal
agencies for maintaining his power; and while
in private life he loved an almost plebeian simplicity,
in public no effect was too striking or too spectacular
to keep up his imperial state.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>No one knew better than Eug&eacute;nie how to arrange
these brilliant effects. Ever since the days when
she was the companion of toreadors and the heroine
of the Corso, love of display and notoriety had been
her ruling passion. She may not have been conscious
of this in the beginning, but what was at first a
habit became by degrees a necessity; and just as the
actress thirsts for applause, so Eug&eacute;nie craved
the admiration and approval of the populace. As
the actress eagerly searches the newspaper columns
after each appearance for the notices of her performance,
so Eug&eacute;nie, after every public entertainment
or review or excursion, devoured the descriptions
published of her costumes and appearance, revelling
in the praises lavished on her person, and
spurred on thereby to fresh efforts to win public
favor. She studied the question of her <i>toilettes</i> as
if it were a religion and she its high priestess. Most
of the fashions of that brilliant period were set by
her, and the lists of guests invited to court
entertainments were subjected to her personal supervision.
Even ladies of high rank were sometimes
refused admission to the Tuileries should their costumes
not suit Her Majesty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>Brought up among the Spanish aristocracy,
famous for elegance and stateliness of manner, and
yet perfectly familiar with the lighter customs of
French society, Eug&eacute;nie succeeded in imparting to
her court a tone of delicacy as well as luxury and
magnificence that made it famous, not only throughout
France, but over half the world. Before she
had been a month on the throne, a thousand tales
were circulated of her beauty, wit, and generosity.
The most enthusiastic accounts were printed of all
she said and did; and the attention of the public
was so occupied with her that it almost forgot to
criticise the politics of the Emperor. Wherever the
imperial pair appeared they were surrounded by
eager throngs; and although here and there some
expressions of disapproval might be heard, the Parisians
were dazzled by a magnificence of display such
as no other city of Europe could equal, and which
conjured up memories of a glorious past that filled
their hearts with pride.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">Chapter IV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">State Visit to England</span></h2>
<p>However the young Empress may have been
regarded in other countries, it was generally
agreed that she understood better than any
of her predecessors how to hold the favor of the
fickle Parisians. It was not public homage, however,
that Eug&eacute;nie craved so much as recognition
from those princes and princesses who had scorned
Mlle. Montijo, the <i>parvenue</i>. It rankled deeply in
her mind that she was not of royal birth; and the
most insignificant princess who could lay claim to
the sovereignty which she adored became an object
of envy to her. Since she could never hope to attain
this or escape a past that must always serve as a
weapon against her, she centred all her desires on
being accepted as an equal by other reigning sovereigns
and received as a guest in their palaces.
Thus for a short time, at least, her origin might be
forgotten.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>To achieve this was by no means an easy task.
All the crowned heads carefully avoided Paris, nor
with all her efforts could she even win over the old
aristocracy of France. Unable to comprehend that
the devotion of the Legitimists to <i>le Roy</i> and his heir
was a sacred principle, linked with precious memories
of the old kingly race, she nevertheless admired their
loyalty and resorted to every possible device to lure
the <i>grandes dames</i> of the Faubourg St. Germain to
her newly established court. But willingly as they
had borne the yoke of the Bourbons, they were too
proud to bend the knee before the Spaniard, and
made it plain that any overtures from the usurper
of their rightful sovereign&rsquo;s throne would be rejected
with contempt.</p>
<p>Compared with the sorrows of her after life, these
humiliations were a small matter; but galling as they
were to her vanity, they were one of the sharpest
thorns in her new crown. In spite of her failure to
win over the old French nobility, she was not long
in earning the respect of the sovereigns of Europe.
Her first opportunity was unexpectedly offered by
the Crimean War (1854-56) in which France&rsquo;s victories
restored the country to its old place as foremost
military power of Europe, and greatly increased
the importance of Napoleon. England had reaped
material advantage from the war and was loud in
praise of the new Empire, and Victoria was finally
forced to invite the usurper and his wife to visit her
at Windsor. A personal acquaintance with the
Queen of England had long been Eug&eacute;nie&rsquo;s most
ardent wish, and this invitation afforded her the
greatest satisfaction. Victoria had hitherto ignored
her in a very marked manner, while at the time of
her marriage the English journals had not only cast
slurs upon her origin, but boldly criticised her life and
conduct. Thus it was doubly desirable for her to
be received at the court of England and to make a
good impression there, for could she but accomplish
this, her position among other sovereigns would be
greatly strengthened. By no means certain as to
the reception that awaited her, she persuaded Napoleon
to send over one of his ministers in advance,
ostensibly to arrange articles of peace with the other
powers, but charged at the same time to settle all
questions of etiquette concerning the impending
visit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>The event itself, however, was of a kind to gratify
the most susceptible vanity and the most aspiring
ambition. Toward evening of the sixteenth of April,
1855, Napoleon and Eug&eacute;nie with their suite landed
on the shores of England, and on the following day
set out on their journey to London, accompanied
by the Prince Consort. Every town and village on
their route was gaily decorated. They were greeted
everywhere with the greatest enthusiasm. As they
passed through Hyde Park, a long line of aristocratic
equipages and equestrians was drawn up on either
side. At Windsor triumphal arches had been
erected. Shops were closed, houses decorated, and
the whole town was on foot to greet Their Majesties.
Amid the shouts and cheers of the populace they
entered the old castle, where Victoria welcomed
them most cordially, having personally seen to all
the arrangements for her guests&rsquo; comfort.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>The day after their arrival the Queen bestowed
the Order of the Garter on Napoleon. Following
this impressive ceremony was a state banquet at
which the famous Windsor gold service made its
appearance; and at the gala performance in the
court theatre that evening a verse in honor of Napoleon
was interpolated in the English National hymn.
The next day London held a grand celebration.
The Emperor and Empress were lauded in the most
flattering songs and speeches; and the people who
had been the deadly enemies of Napoleon the First,
the country in which Prince Louis Napoleon had
lived as a refugee, ill, friendless, often in dire need,
now hailed Napoleon the Third as its friend and
ally.</p>
<p>The results of this visit to Great Britain were
most gratifying to the imperial pair. The enthusiasm
of the British made an excellent impression
in France and strengthened public confidence in
Napoleon&rsquo;s wisdom and prudence, while the friendship
of the English royal family added importance
to the young dynasty in Germany, and left no excuse
for other sovereign houses to hold aloof from the
Tuileries. Lastly, not only were Eug&eacute;nie&rsquo;s fondest
hopes realized, but she had also made a life-long
friend. At their very first meeting Eug&eacute;nie&rsquo;s charm
completely won the Queen&rsquo;s heart. This beautiful
woman with her ease and dignity of manner bore
little resemblance to the notorious belle of gay
resorts as she had been described; and forgetting all
these unpleasant rumors, she succumbed at once
to the Empress&rsquo;s attractions. The friendship thus
begun grew closer with subsequent meetings and
continued unbroken for many years.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>A few months later, the Queen of England with
her husband and two eldest children came to Paris
to return her new friend&rsquo;s visit. For more than
four hundred years no English sovereign had visited
the French capital, so it was an event of great importance.
The Queen, who writes with enthusiasm
in her diary of the journey to France, describes their
reception as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the eighteenth of August we left Osborne
about five o&rsquo;clock in the morning on our yacht, the
Victoria and Albert, reaching Boulogne about two, where
we were greeted with shouts of welcome from
the people and troops drawn up along the shore.
The Emperor, with his staff, stood waiting in the
sun till the gangplank was thrown out, when he
stepped aboard. I went forward to meet him, and
he kissed my hand. We four, that is, the Prince, the
Prince of Wales, Princess Victoria, and myself, then
entered a coach and drove through the streets,
everywhere crowded with people and beautifully
decorated with flags, to the railway station, the
Emperor accompanying us on horseback.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>In the capital great preparations had been made
for their reception, Napoleon having ridden about
everywhere in person to see that all was complete.
At the railway station, which was covered with floral
decorations, eighty beautiful young girls were waiting
to present the Queen with bouquets. Through
a sea of light from lamps and torches, amid the
strains of music, the rolling of drums, and incessant
cheering, the royal party made its way through the
Bois to St. Cloud, where the Empress, Princess
Mathilde, and all the ladies of the court were waiting
to receive it.</p>
<p>The World&rsquo;s Exposition had just been opened
in Paris at that time, and the week spent by the
English guests at the French court was devoted to
seeing that, as well as the sights of the city itself.
Besides this, a number of state entertainments were
given in their honor, concluding with a ball at Versailles
that exceeded in magnificence any given since
the time of Louis the Fourteenth. Three thousand
invitations were issued for this, and all the <i>&eacute;lite</i> of
France were present, with many distinguished foreigners.
The gay uniforms and court dresses of
the men and the gorgeous costumes of the ladies, who
vied with one another in their display of
jewels, laces, and brocades, made a scene of surpassing
brilliancy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>The Empress, who appeared at this ball in all her
radiant loveliness, was taken ill during the supper
and obliged to retire to her own apartments. On
several other occasions also she was indisposed and
forced to excuse herself. Yet though unable to take
an active part in public festivities, Eug&eacute;nie and Victoria
became all the more intimate in their own
private circle. Napoleon and the Prince Consort
sang duets together. Victoria made several sketches
of the country about St. Cloud and often visited
Eug&eacute;nie in her own apartments where the two princesses
sat for hours together in confidential talk.
A friendship so close and lasting between such widely
different natures must have been founded on more
than physical attraction. A mutual appreciation
of each other&rsquo;s best qualities drew them together.
Eug&eacute;nie was bolder and more independent than her
friend, and freer from prejudice; but Victoria had
the strength and repose that come from an inherited
consciousness of power, while they were united by
a common devotion to their own families, and pride
in the nations over which they ruled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">Chapter V</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Birth of the Prince Imperial</span></h2>
<p>Early on the morning of the sixteenth of
March, 1856, a son was born to the imperial
pair, and a salute of a hundred and one guns
proclaimed the great news to the public, who received
it with the wildest enthusiasm. The whole city was
decorated with flags, garlands, and portraits of the
Emperor and Empress, and ablaze with illuminations
at night; while the City Council granted a
sum of two hundred thousand francs for a feast for
the poor. Greater still was the joy of the royal
parents. The Emperor took the little Prince in
his arms and carried him out to show to the assembled
court, with tears of pride and happiness. He at
once ordered a million francs to be distributed in
charity to celebrate the event; had it publicly proclaimed
that he and the Empress would act as
sponsors to all legitimate children born on that day
within the borders of his Empire, and issued a decree
permitting all political exiles to return to France on
condition that they would swear to uphold the
Government and obey the laws of the country.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>Soon after the birth of the Prince Imperial a congress
met to determine the articles of peace which
concluded the Crimean War and restored the peace
of Europe, and Napoleon was appointed arbiter.
At the zenith of his power and with the future of
his dynasty seemingly secured, it did not appear
altogether presumptuous when in replying to the
congratulations of the Assembly he expressed a hope
in the brightness of his son&rsquo;s future as heir to the
throne of France.</p>
<p>Eug&eacute;nie&rsquo;s position was greatly strengthened by
this happy event, for now, should she survive her
husband (as seemed probable from the difference
in their ages), as mother of Napoleon the Fourth
she would have still greater influence in public
affairs. Her marriage to Napoleon the Third had
revived memories of Josephine. Like the wife of
the great Emperor she had been born under a southern
sky; like her she had seemed destined from the
cradle to wear a crown; and as long as she remained
childless there were not lacking hints that a similar
fate might be in store for her. But Providence had
ordained otherwise. As a mother Eug&eacute;nie was
seated more firmly than ever on the throne of France,
and universally regarded with respect, almost with
reverence. Gifts flowed in from all sides. No less
than twenty-eight orders were bestowed on the
baby Prince. Messages of congratulation came from
all parts of the Empire. Even the fishwives of the
Halle came to offer their good wishes, and engravings
of the Empress and her child were scattered by
hundreds of thousands throughout the country.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>In the early Summer of 1856, terrific floods caused
much suffering and distress in many parts of France,
in consequence of which there was some talk of
having the Prince Imperial&rsquo;s christening celebrated
quietly. Unwilling, however, to lose an opportunity
of showing the world that his dynasty, though
young in years was inferior to none of the older
monarchies in wealth and splendor, Napoleon determined
to send the flood victims one half of the
sum which would originally have been devoted to
the christening festivities, and with the other half
he still managed to make an impressive display.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>Not for many years had there been such excitement
in Paris as on that summer day, which was to
witness the baptism of the heir of Napoleon the
Third. At six o&rsquo;clock in the morning the pealing
of bells and the thunder of cannon proclaimed that
the great day had come, and at the first sound,
swarms of eager spectators poured into the streets.
All the boulevards and squares were filled in a few
hours, and by the time incoming trains had deposited
their freight of strangers and provincials, the crowds
were so dense it was impossible to cross the Seine.
A deafening shout greeted the appearance of the
gilded state coach bearing the little Prince with his
governess and nurse; nor was the enthusiasm lessened
when close behind followed the happy parents
with their suite. No less a person than the Holy
Father at Rome was godfather to the Spaniard&rsquo;s
child, while Queen Josephine of Norway and Sweden
acted as godmother. The ceremony at Notre Dame
was most striking and impressive. All the clergy of
France were present; on entering the great shadowy
Cathedral, dimly lighted by the myriad wax tapers
on the altar, one might easily have imagined himself
suddenly transported to a scene in the Middle
Ages.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>That evening the city of Paris gave a magnificent
banquet in honor of the imperial family, at which
the whole court and many foreign guests were present.
It was held in the great hall of the H&ocirc;tel de
Ville, lit up by eighteen thousand wax candles. The
silver service used was made expressly for the occasion
at a cost of two hundred and fifty thousand
francs and the flowers alone came to twenty thousand
francs. Two orchestras alternated in furnishing
music; and at the close all present rose and sang
&ldquo;<i>Vive l&rsquo;Empereur!</i>&rdquo; The popularity of the Empress
was proven by a surprise that had been prepared
for her in the form of a diorama representing the
various places with which she had some special association:&mdash;Granada
her birthplace; Madrid, with
the Prado; the forest of Compi&egrave;gne; Fontainebleau,
where the Emperor had confessed his love for her;
the chamber which she had occupied in the &Eacute;lys&eacute;e
before her marriage; the wedding of the imperial
pair at Notre Dame; the Prince Imperial&rsquo;s apartment
at the Tuileries; the palace of St. Cloud; and
the cascade in the Bois de Boulogne. At the conclusion
of the banquet Napoleon and Eug&eacute;nie appeared
on one of the balconies of the H&ocirc;tel de Ville
and were greeted with the wildest enthusiasm by
the crowds that had gathered to admire the fireworks
and the illuminations. All were charmed with the
Emperor&rsquo;s graciousness and the beauty of the Empress,
but most of all with the little Prince Imperial
whom the people affectionately nicknamed &ldquo;Lulu.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>

<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Empress in Politics</span></h2>
<p>Napoleon&rsquo;s position at this time seemed
impregnable. France had played an honorable
part in the Crimean War and covered
herself with glory at the fall of Sebastopol. Yet
the nephew of the great Napoleon had remained far
from the field of battle himself, and felt the need
of winning some personal laurels to add to his prestige.
The shrewd policy of Count Cavour, the
Italian statesman, had greatly increased the power
of the kingdom of Sardinia; and thither the Emperor
now turned his glances. At a secret meeting with
Cavour he guaranteed the support of France to
Sardinia in case of war with Austria; but before
this pledge could be redeemed an event occurred
which might have made the agreement of little
avail. It deserves mention here as furnishing a
proof of Eug&eacute;nie&rsquo;s courage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>On the eleventh of January, 1858, a special performance
of grand opera was to be given, and a
crowd of loyal subjects had gathered about the
theatre to witness the arrival of the sovereigns. As
the state coach drew up before the entrance, two
bombs were hurled at it, and a frightful explosion
followed. Windows in all the neighboring streets
were shattered, and a hundred and sixty persons,
among them a number of soldiers and outriders,
were killed or badly wounded. A fragment of shell
pierced the Emperor&rsquo;s hat; and Eug&eacute;nie, who tried
to protect her husband&rsquo;s body with her own, received
a slight graze on the temple, bespattering her white
silk dress with blood. Yet, perfectly calm and
undismayed, she stood up at once and called out
words of reassurance to the panic-stricken people.
As if nothing had happened, Their Majesties entered
the theatre, and with her usual winning smile the
Empress bowed her thanks to the burst of applause
that greeted them. Felix Orsini, the Italian who
had thrown the bombs, was immediately seized and
thrown into prison with his accomplices.</p>
<p>In a proclamation issued on January first, 1859,
the Emperor revealed his intention of severing
friendly relations with Austria; and on the outbreak
of war between that country and Sardinia, he hastened
to the support of his new ally, May 10, 1859,
publicly declaring that &ldquo;Italy must be free from the
Alps to the Adriatic.&rdquo; The victories of Magenta
and Solferino, which followed, added fresh glories
to the arms of France; and although the peace of
Villafranca failed to redeem all his lofty promises,
Napoleon was hailed as the deliverer of Italy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>Meanwhile there had been a change in the Government
at home which greatly added to Eug&eacute;nie&rsquo;s
importance. Shortly after Orsini&rsquo;s unsuccessful
attempt, the Assembly passed a law appointing her
Regent of France in the Emperor&rsquo;s absence, or during
her son&rsquo;s minority in case of his death; and on
Napoleon&rsquo;s departure for Italy the reins of government
were placed for the first time in her hands. It
was a critical period at which to confide the direction
of affairs to a woman; had the war been less fortunate
in its issue, the situation might have proved as
dangerous as it afterwards became, in 1870.</p>
<p>If any decisive influence on French politics was
attributed to Eug&eacute;nie on this or subsequent occasions,
it was a mistaken idea. As a matter of fact her
regency was little more than an empty farce in which
Napoleon allowed his wife to play the chief part.
It deluded the people and flattered the Empress to
see her name at the head of all state documents;
but absent or present, although he permitted Eug&eacute;nie
to share in the ministerial councils, he was careful
not to trust the reins of government for any length
of time to other hands than his own. On the other
hand, it cannot be denied that the Empress, when
she chose to exert herself, well knew how to achieve
her ends. Once an idea became fixed in her mind
she would assail the Emperor with arguments and
entreaties until he finally yielded, if only for the
sake of peace; nor did she scruple to intrigue against
the ministers when they refused to carry out her
wishes in the bestowal of honors and positions on
favorites of her own, often quite unworthy of such
favors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>Her real political influence was greatly overestimated.
Her talents did not lie in that direction,
nor had she any conception of the intricate machinery
of government. Absorbed in a thousand trifles, court
festivals, fashions, and intrigues, she had neither
time nor inclination to pursue such aims with any
system or resolution. Yet there was one case in
which she did make trouble by her interference.
This was shortly before the Franco-Prussian War,
when she brought all her influence to bear in behalf
of the Church.</p>
<p>The Papal party had spared no pains to secure
Eug&eacute;nie&rsquo;s friendship and strengthen her in the conviction
that she had been chosen by Providence as
one of the chief supports of God&rsquo;s vicegerent on
earth. Full of gratitude to the Deity for this special
mark of favor, and firmly believing in her destiny,
she yielded blindly to all the wishes of the clergy,
thus openly proclaiming herself the head of the clerical
party. She devoted her energies to the support
of the Papal power and to a revival of the spirit
Catholicism throughout the country. No mercy was
shown to those who dissented from the old faith.
Even her attendants, with few exceptions, were
chosen according to their religious views. Naturally
this overzealousness could not fail to excite
much opposition, and Eug&eacute;nie soon had not only
the envy and prejudice of society to contend against,
but the enmity of the free-thinkers, including many
of Napoleon&rsquo;s best friends.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>Of these, Prince Napoleon was the most bitter.
Quite as firmly as Napoleon the Third believed it
his mission to be sovereign of France, did this Prince
feel himself destined to the throne; but while the
former supported his ideas with Napoleonic tactics,
the latter based his claims chiefly on a remarkable
likeness to the first Emperor. Louis Napoleon had
worked hard to attain his goal. His cousin contented
himself with spending hours before his mirror, arranging
the Napoleonic lock of hair upon his forehead&mdash;a
sign that he should one day wear the
crown of France. As long as the Emperor was without
issue he regarded himself as certainly the heir.
The birth of the Prince Imperial therefore was a
bitter blow to him; and when the law was passed
giving Eug&eacute;nie the power of Regent, his rage and
chagrin knew no bounds. He had never been able
to endure the Spaniard, but had hidden his dislike
at first under a mask of cold politeness. Now that
he no longer had any reason for concealing his true
feelings, he gave full vent to his malice, annoying
the Empress constantly by petty personal attacks,
and circulating the most shameful reports concerning
her private life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>Eug&eacute;nie returned the Prince&rsquo;s hatred with all her
heart. His dissolute life, evil tongue, and above
all, the cowardice he had shown on more than one
glaring occasion, made him detestable to her. She
retaliated by exposing this side of his character on
every possible occasion, thus provoking him constantly
to fresh attacks. The relation between
them was not improved by the Prince&rsquo;s marriage in
January, 1859, to Clothilde of Savoy, the lovely
young Princess to whom the people of Paris gave
the name of St. Clothilde. He knew that his marriage
to a royal princess would enrage the Empress.
While Clothilde had yielded to her father&rsquo;s wishes
in the matter, personally she felt nothing but
aversion for the cynical, dissolute free-thinker, for
many years the avowed lover of the actress Rachel;
nor was he a person likely to capture the fancy of
Victor Emanuel&rsquo;s innocent young daughter.</p>
<p>At court, as in her own household, Clothilde stood
well-nigh alone, therefore. She excited the jealousy
rather than the sympathy of Eug&eacute;nie&mdash;while in her
own heart the Princess of royal birth felt little but
contempt for the adventurous Empress. She absented
herself from court as much as possible and
gathered about her a little circle of her own, those
aristocrats who had scorned to pay homage to the
Countess Montijo. Yet whenever obliged to appear
at the Imperial Court, she fulfilled all the requirements
of her position with charming dignity. Once
when Eug&eacute;nie, who found court etiquette most tiresome
and fatiguing, asked if it did not weary her,
she replied innocently, unconscious of the sting that
lay within the words, &ldquo;Certainly not! I have
been accustomed to it all my life.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>Although Prince Napoleon was the most hated of
all Eug&eacute;nie&rsquo;s enemies, he was by no means the only
member of the Emperor&rsquo;s family who disliked her.
Even the kindly, gentle Princess Mathilde looked
askance at her cousin&rsquo;s wife, though she was tactful
enough not to betray her feeling. Napoleon&rsquo;s
friendly attachment for her had continued even
after his marriage, and he used often to ask her advice
in important matters; but the Empress never
visited her, and the Princess, who had once presided
at the Tuileries, no longer appeared there except on
state occasions when it was unavoidable.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>The general feeling against Eug&eacute;nie that prevailed
did not find open expression till 1861, when
the Emperor returned as victor to his capital from
Italy. The Italian people had chosen Victor Emanuel
as their sovereign, and the unity of that country
met with such approval in France, that when
Napoleon failed formally to recognize the new order
of things, many attributed his delay to Eug&eacute;nie&rsquo;s
influence. As a devout Catholic she would gladly
have seen the hated Victor Emanuel&rsquo;s kingdom overthrown
and the Pope&rsquo;s supremacy restored; and
while Napoleon can scarcely have shared these feelings,
he realized that it was to his interest to keep
on good terms with the clerical party, and that to
renounce the friendship of the Pope would deprive
him of a powerful support. He therefore permitted
the Pope to retain Rome and the &ldquo;Patrimonium St.
Petri,&rdquo; and, on the Empress&rsquo;s insistence, he agreed
to leave a body of French troops in Italy to defend
the Papal interests, at the same time publicly recognizing
Victor Emanuel as King of Italy, and the
provinces revolting from the Church as parts of the
new kingdom. This vacillating course pleased
neither party, and blame was laid chiefly on the
Empress, whose zeal for the Papacy was but too
well known. Her exclamation, &ldquo;If the Pope leaves
the Quirinal, I shall leave the Tuileries! I would
rather have the Emperor murdered than see him
delivered over to everlasting damnation!&rdquo; passed
from mouth to mouth and added still further to
the prejudice against her among the intelligent
population of France.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Private Life of the Empress</span></h2>
<p>Besides the annoyances caused by the ill-will
of the anti-clerical party, Eug&eacute;nie at this
time had also sorrows and anxieties of her
own to endure. Painful as her youthful passion for
the Duke of Alva had been, it had failed to affect
the close affection of the two sisters&mdash;an attachment
that only deepened as time went on. The
Duchess and her husband frequently spent their
winters in Paris, and were always sure of a cordial
welcome from the imperial pair.</p>
<p>Eug&eacute;nie&rsquo;s life before her marriage was one of such
freedom that although she fulfilled all her duties as
sovereign with dignity and apparent content, there
were many lonely hours when her thoughts turned
longingly to those youthful days in Spain and to the
dear ones there, especially her mother, with whom
the Duchess of Alva was now her only link. The
Duchess had been afflicted for some time with an
incurable malady, though Eug&eacute;nie was ignorant of
its serious nature. While travelling with the Emperor
in August, 1860, she was shocked to receive
word that her sister&rsquo;s condition had changed greatly
for the worse. The august travellers were then in
Algiers, and Eug&eacute;nie begged Napoleon to turn back
at once. But elaborate preparations had been made
for their entertainment and to abandon the festivities
would have been too great a disappointment to
the people. Torn with anxiety, the Empress attended
a grand ball given in their honor, and not
till it was over did she learn the sad truth that her
sister was dying. She sailed at once for France, but
it was too late. Before she reached land the Duchess
had expired. It was a terrible blow to Eug&eacute;nie;
overcome with grief she shut herself up in her own
apartments, refusing to see any one. It was months
before she recovered herself sufficiently to appear
again in court circles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>Nor was this all. Although Napoleon&rsquo;s marriage
with the beautiful Spaniard had been one of love
alone, yet the passion with which she inspired him
gradually cooled, and although he continued to treat
his wife invariably with the same respect and admiration
he had shown in their early married life, there
were many occasions when he gave her cause for
jealousy.</p>
<p>In these conjugal trials the Duchess of Alva had
been her confidante and had helped her through
many bitter hours. Now that this gentle comforter
was gone she felt doubly the neglect so hard for her
warm and generous nature to endure; and these
sorrows, added to anxiety for the health of her
son, cast a permanent shadow over her bright spirits.
She fell more and more under the influence of the
priesthood, devoted herself to religious works, had
new convents built, and even thought of making a
pilgrimage to Jerusalem. This plan was afterwards
abandoned, but her irritability, capriciousness, and
bigotry reduced her household to desperation. The
constant alternations of religious frenzy and feverish
pursuit of pleasure, of extreme gayety and deepest
melancholy, characteristic of the Empress&rsquo;s later
life, were no doubt due to an overwrought nervous
system, like the hysterical fits of laughing or weeping
that often seized her without any apparent cause.
But with so gay and sanguine a temperament as
hers, these moods never lasted long; and her warm-heartedness
never failed to win the affection of those
about her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>Among the friendships formed by Eug&eacute;nie, that
with the Princess Metternich is of especial interest,
since no lady of the Imperial Court was so much
talked of and criticised as the young wife of the
Austrian ambassador. From Vienna, where they
had been favorites at the Austrian court, the
Metternichs had come to Paris in 1860, shortly
after the conclusion of peace between Italy, France,
and Austria, and soon after their own marriage.
Born of one of the oldest and most distinguished
families in the country, Pauline Metternich was at
once a type of the proud aristocrat and the gay,
witty, thoughtless Viennese, full of original and daring
ideas, which she took no pains to conceal. In
the days of the Empire the Austrian Embassy was
the rendezvous of all the rank, wealth, and intellect
of Paris. Disciples of art and literature, diplomats
and government officials and Legitimists from St.
Germain met in these salons. Even the Emperor
and Empress often made their appearance there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>At their very first meeting the Princess had conceived
the greatest admiration for Eug&eacute;nie; and with
the exception of her young niece Anna Murat (afterward
Duchess of Monchy), for whom the Empress
had an almost motherly affection, no one was so
close to her as the Princess Metternich. Perfect
sympathy of tastes, and a certain magnetic attraction
for which there is no explanation, proved the
foundation of an intimate friendship that lasted for
years. Pauline&rsquo;s sparkling wit and vivacity were
of just the sort to strike a responsive chord in so
lively a nature as Eug&eacute;nie&rsquo;s. She was the soul of
all the <i>f&ecirc;tes</i> at Compi&egrave;gne and Fontainebleau, and
added to the long evenings at court a life and gayety
they often sadly lacked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>At home the Princess Metternich was an excellent
wife and mother, and attended personally to every
detail of her household. In society, however, she
disregarded all conventions, spoke her mind freely
on all occasions, and had the courage to stand up
for her convictions. The brilliant witticisms and
clever sayings attributed to her are numberless;
they were repeated not only among the court and
diplomatic circles, but even by the public. Her
influence in the world of fashion was almost equal
to that of the Empress, but she was always causing
painful embarrassments to her imitators. One day
she would appear dressed with a simplicity and
plainness that would not have been permitted in
any one else; the next, her costume would be of a
costliness no one could possibly hope to rival. She
was a clever mimic, and would delight the whole
court with her imitations of Madame Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, a
well known music-hall singer, the Empress usually
leading in the applause; yet on formal occasions no
one at court could appear with greater dignity and
stateliness. In fact Eug&eacute;nie&rsquo;s fondness for her was
partly founded on that weakness for birth and rank
of which we have already spoken. She was peculiarly
sensitive as to her own origin, and no greater
insult could be inflicted upon her than any allusion
to it. The French authoress Olympe Andouard relates
an instance of this that almost severed the friendship
between Eug&eacute;nie and the Princess Metternich.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>It was during one of the court evenings at Fontainebleau
which happened to be most dull and
tedious. Among those present, as usual, was the
wife of the Austrian ambassador to whom private
apartments had been assigned in a wing of the palace.
Weary at last of the monotony, Pauline whispered
to a friend that she would feign a bad headache and
retire to her own rooms, whither the friend was to
follow quietly with a dozen chosen ladies and cavaliers.
No sooner said than done. The headache
served as an excuse. The Princess withdrew and
hastily prepared to receive her guests, who soon
succeeded in stealing away unobserved. All was
going well. The music and dancing were at their
height, when suddenly the door opened and Eug&eacute;nie
appeared&mdash;to inquire for her poor Pauline whose
&ldquo;frightful headache&rdquo; had filled her with sympathy.
In spite of her nervous temperament Eug&eacute;nie on
certain occasions (usually unimportant) was not
lacking in the necessary calm and self-possession.
Instead of laughing at the lively scene before her,
she was indignant and reproved the Princess sharply
for her lack of proper respect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame!&rdquo; replied the diplomat&rsquo;s wife no less
hotly, &ldquo;you forget that I was born a great lady and
submit to no reprimands!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In consequence of this scene the Princess was
forced to absent herself from court for a time, and
only by degrees was the old familiarity restored.</p>
<p>Next to Pauline Metternich the most important
member of the Empress&rsquo;s small private circle was
Prosper Merim&eacute;e, the clever author&mdash;&ldquo;the Empress&rsquo;s
court jester,&rdquo; as he laughingly called himself.
He had first met the Countess Montijo while Eug&eacute;nie
was still a child, and the acquaintance had ripened
with years into a close friendship which was shared
by the imperial pair. Although not strictly speaking
a member of the court, both Napoleon and
Eug&eacute;nie treated him as a member of their family,
and the bigoted Empress not only honored him as
a gifted author, but felt an almost sisterly affection
for the avowed free-thinker.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Paris under the Second Empire</span></h2>
<p>The Danish writer, Hermann Bang, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It was a strangely mixed society that formed
the court of the Second Empire, and during this splendid
period Paris became more than ever a brilliant social
arena. New names and new celebrities sprang up like
mushrooms and withered away as quickly. Since life
was short, it must needs be rapid. Looking back upon
it now, one is reminded of a juggler&rsquo;s performance at the
circus. The glittering balls fly about in bewildering numbers
and seem to fill the whole air. Different performers
come and go, but the dazzling display continues. This
society was neither composed of the representative families
of France nor yet of the mass of the population, who
supported the Government, and to whom the Second
Empire seemed a complete restoration of the glories of
the First. Truly the richest legacy of greatness is the
magic that lies in a name.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>Napoleon was well aware of the value of the name
he bore. He had not forgotten that to it alone he
owed his possession of the throne; and he determined
that the name at which Europe had trembled and
which all France adored should serve as the foundation
of his power. As far as possible he tried to revive all
the Napoleonic traditions and preserve the fond illusion
of the Parisians. Everything about the court
was conducted on a scale of the greatest magnificence.
Uniforms of officials, ministers, and deputies were a
mass of gold embroidery. The gorgeousness of the
palace guards suggested the operatic stage; customs
of the time of Louis the Fourteenth were even revived.
Visits from foreign sovereigns were attended
with an almost fabulous display, and with Napoleon&rsquo;s
rising importance these visits became more
and more frequent. Indeed there were times during
the Second Empire when whole solar systems of
potentates revolved about one another.</p>
<p>On Thursday evenings during the winter, dinners
were given at the Tuileries for diplomats and state
officials, followed by receptions and dancing. Four
court balls were given in the course of the season,
to which as many as five thousand invitations were
issued, and which were marked by the utmost
splendor. Both sides of the grand staircase were
lined with palace guards. Guests waited in the
galleries until the arrival of the sovereigns, when
the doors of the great salon were thrown open
and the Emperor and Empress took their places on
the dais, the princes and princesses grouped about
them. The Empress danced only the opening quadrille
on these occasions, and at eleven retired with
the Emperor to a smaller salon where there was also
dancing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>Eug&eacute;nie possessed the truly royal gift of never
forgetting a face or a name, and always had a kindly
word or glance for every one as she passed through
the crowded room; but when it was over and she
reached her own apartments, she would be completely
exhausted with the weight of the crown jewels, which
she wore in the greatest profusion on these occasions.
Sometimes she would not even wait for her women,
but would snatch off the crown and heavy ornaments
and toss them into the lap of the lady-in-waiting,
who bore them carefully away, for each
was worth a fortune. Besides these grand balls to
which any one with the slightest claim to rank or
position could easily obtain admission, the most
splendid and original masquerades were given in
Carnival time, to which invitations were more
limited. During Lent there were no entertainments
with the exception of four state concerts given under
the direction of Auber, then court <i>kapellmeister</i>, and
Count Bacciocchi, director of the theatre, in which
all the most famous artists took part.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>Far more interesting than these semi-official affairs
were the weekly Monday receptions held by the
Empress in her own apartments. Only a select few
were invited to these, and the Empress&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mondays&rdquo;
soon became famous all over Europe. Napoleon and
Eug&eacute;nie received their guests with the greatest cordiality,
and conversed familiarly with all. Here
Princess Metternich shone her brightest; here too
were seen the beautiful Princess Murat, Duchess of
Monchy; the gallant Count Walewski, who so
closely resembled his father, the great Napoleon;
the Emperor&rsquo;s half-brother, the Duke de Morny;
and his youthful friend and ally Duke Fialni de
Persigny. Here Merim&eacute;e&rsquo;s inexhaustible fund of
wit and humor found full play. Here the Emperor&rsquo;s
favorite, General Fleury, and the elegant Marquis
de Caux (afterward the husband of Adelina Patti)
led the cotillon and invented figures that made the
rounds of Europe.</p>
<p>Scarcely less famous in their way were the hunting
parties held by the court at Compi&egrave;gne every
autumn. To these only a few were invited at a
time, and the weekly list of guests was prepared with
as much care as if it had been some important affair
of state. Fifteen new gowns of the costliest kind
were regarded as indispensable by the feminine
world for a visit to Compi&egrave;gne. Many feigned illness
to escape the expense of so many new <i>toilettes</i>,
while others were almost ruined by accepting the
invitations. Art, literature, and science were well
represented at these gatherings; and once arrived
at Compi&egrave;gne, all received the most cordial welcome,
no matter what their political opinions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>Next to court entertainments the most popular
rendezvous for the world of fashion in the days of
the Empire was the opera; and although it then had
its home in the narrow <i>Rue Lepelletier</i>, instead of
its present magnificent palace, this did not deter
royalty and all the highest society from attending
regularly. Full dress was required, and the costly
gowns and the jewels of the ladies, with the brilliant
uniforms of the men, lent an air of festivity to each
performance that is usually seen only on some gala
occasion. But if grand opera were the temple of
art in which Eug&eacute;nie showed herself most often, it
was by no means her favorite place of amusement.
She not only lacked all knowledge of the higher
music, but it was distasteful to her; and even well
written drama at the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Fran&ccedil;ais had no interest
for her. On the other hand, she adored anything
amusing and had the greatest fondness for
Offenbach&rsquo;s lively airs. Her musical taste may be
judged by the fact that during the Czar Alexander
of Russia&rsquo;s stay in Paris in 1867, she could think of
no greater mark of attention than to send him
tickets for a performance of the &ldquo;Grande Duchesse
de Gerolstein.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her fancied resemblance to Marie Antoinette has
already been mentioned; indeed, there were many
points of similarity between the Spanish Countess
and Maria Theresa&rsquo;s unfortunate daughter. Both
possessed remarkable beauty, charm, energy, and
strength of character. Both were boundlessly extravagant
and open-handed, as both in their younger
days allowed the pursuit of pleasure to banish all
serious occupations. Eug&eacute;nie avoided the imprudences
of which Marie Antoinette was guilty, and
instead of risking her popularity, did all in her power
to preserve and strengthen it; yet she too was powerless
to escape calumny. There were but too many
evil tongues ready to suggest that a woman who
owed her sovereignty to beauty alone was scarce
likely to remain a pattern of virtue, and we have
seen how even in her own family she had enemies
who tried to undermine her reputation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>The court of the Second Empire was full of corruption
and was abandoned to a life of pleasure and
luxury. But it is ever the way of aristocratic society
to seek amusement; and if at the courts of Berlin
and London a more serious tone prevailed, those of
Vienna, St. Petersburg, and Madrid were scarcely
less frivolous than that of France under the Second
Empire.</p>
<p>The Empress&rsquo;s daily life was very different from
this; intermixed with the feverish pursuit of pleasure
were many days of weariness and ennui. At eight
o&rsquo;clock she rose and devoted an hour regularly,
sometimes two or three, to her favorite occupation,
the study of her <i>toilettes</i>. At half-past eleven she
breakfasted alone with the Emperor and the Prince
Imperial, after which Napoleon would smoke a cigarette
in his wife&rsquo;s apartment, chatting and playing
with his little son. Kindness of heart was one of the
Emperor&rsquo;s most marked characteristics. Indeed he
was often over-indulgent with the child&mdash;a weakness
Eug&eacute;nie continually struggled against, with the
natural result that the little Prince preferred his
father to his mother. At one, every day he went
for his drive in the Bois de Boulogne, and the Empress
retired to her study, back of the audience
chamber, where no one was allowed to enter. Here
her tastes and habits were best displayed, for in this
room she had surrounded herself with all her most
precious possessions, portraits of her family and
intimate friends, busts, vases, statuettes, and all
sorts of personal souvenirs, and a small set of bookshelves
containing the works of French, Spanish,
English, and Italian writers. Every day Eug&eacute;nie
wrote to her mother, a sacred duty with which
neither <i>f&ecirc;te</i> nor illness, travel nor court entertainment,
was ever allowed to interfere. Among others
with whom she also kept up a lively correspondence
were Queen Victoria and the Queen of Holland.
After the Empress&rsquo;s personal letters were finished
she summoned her secretary, Damas Hinard, with
whom she went through the vast number of begging
letters and appeals of all kinds she received daily,
to each of which she gave her personal attention.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>Adjoining Eug&eacute;nie&rsquo;s bedchamber was an anteroom
without windows in which a lamp was always
burning, and from which a narrow stairway led to
the Emperor&rsquo;s apartments. Concealed in the wainscoting
of this room by sliding panels were a number
of caskets, all numbered and marked in cipher. To
look over and arrange their contents was one of
Eug&eacute;nie&rsquo;s favorite amusements. Here she kept not
only her own private papers, but many interesting
contributions to the history of Napoleon the First
and his times, in the form of letters from statesmen
soldiers, and scholars. All the Emperor&rsquo;s discarded
documents and correspondence were carefully preserved
by Eug&eacute;nie, and stored away where only she
could get at them. Napoleon was much amused at
this mania of hers for collecting, and she herself
used to laugh over it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am like a little mouse, running around after
the Emperor and picking up all the crumbs he lets
fall,&rdquo; she once said.</p>
<p>The ladies-in-waiting did not live in the Tuileries;
it was only during the summer that they were constantly
with her, whether travelling about or at one
of the summer palaces. Of these, some were naturally
more congenial than others, but Eug&eacute;nie had
no choice in the matter of a companion; this was
regulated strictly by the law of precedence. Day
after day she entered her carriage, accompanied by
whichever lady was entitled by etiquette to a seat
in the imperial equipage, and drove through the
Bois, bowing incessantly to left and right, and day
after day she returned at exactly the same hour in
time to dress for dinner.</p>
<p>Besides these monotonous outings, she sometimes
drove out in the morning in a carriage drawn by only
two horses. Each man and footman wore the plainest
livery, and she and her companion were quite
simply dressed. On these occasions she attended to
all her charitable errands. She liked to investigate
in person all the cases that especially appealed to her
sympathies, and always carried with her a well filled
purse, the money thus dispensed often amounting to
a considerable sum in the course of a year.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>&ldquo;I could just as well send what I give to the poor,&rdquo;
she declared, &ldquo;but one should do a little good oneself.
The sight of so much misery and suffering makes it
easier to bear one&rsquo;s own troubles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of all the Empress&rsquo;s attendants the one to whom
she was most attached was Madame Pollet, or P&eacute;pa
as she called her. This woman, the only Spaniard
in her service, had entered it in early youth, and
remained with her ever after. She had accompanied
her on all her travels and shared all the vicissitudes
of her mistress, whom she adored and for whom she
would have gladly died. She had charge of the
Empress&rsquo;s wardrobe and personal belongings, and
was untiring in her efforts to fulfil the slightest wish
of Eug&eacute;nie, who on her part, while she never allowed
the distance between them to be forgotten, returned
the affection and reposed the most boundless confidence
in P&eacute;pa. Madame Pollet was supposed to
have great influence with the Empress, and wives
of high officials were not ashamed to court her
favor and load her with gifts when they wanted
something of her mistress. But P&eacute;pa, a modest
little creature, had no desire to meddle with matters
that did not concern her; besides she was far too
busy and too much in demand by Eug&eacute;nie to have
time for other things.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>The dinner hour at the Tuileries was half-past
seven. At this meal the Prince Imperial, after his
eighth year, was present as well as all the ladies and
gentlemen of the court. Shortly before the hour,
the Emperor went to his wife&rsquo;s apartments and escorted
her to the Hall of Apollo, where the court
awaited Their Majesties. As soon as dinner was
served the palace prefect was notified, who in turn
informed the Emperor; Napoleon gave his arm to
Eug&eacute;nie and the rest followed in order of rank.
The ceremony was simple but strictly in accordance
with etiquette. At table a young blackamoor, whom
she had brought with her from Algiers, always stood
behind Eug&eacute;nie&rsquo;s chair, and waited on her with as
lofty an air as if he were fulfilling some sacred office.
He was said to be of noble birth, and proudly refused
to serve any one but the Empress.</p>
<p>After dinner, which was served with such smoothness
and precision that it seldom lasted more than
three-quarters of an hour, the court returned to the
Hall of Apollo, where the evening was spent, usually
in a most tedious manner. The presence of the sovereigns
prevented any spontaneous general conversation.
The Emperor himself rarely spoke at all,
while Eug&eacute;nie, finding this atmosphere of repression
unbearable, talked incessantly with the nervous
vivacity peculiar to her. To vary the monotony of
these evenings, reading aloud was sometimes suggested
but it was difficult to find anything suitable
for such an assemblage. A French or English romance
would entertain the Empress but bored the
Emperor horribly; while if a scientific work that
interested Napoleon were chosen, Eug&eacute;nie would
yawn, therefore this too had to be abandoned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>The Emperor was fond of solitaire, which he often
played; but it did not amuse Eug&eacute;nie except when
she did not feel like talking, which was seldom the
case. There was never music or card-playing at
the palace. Once in a great while the Empress
would have a sudden fancy to do something, as
when, for example, late one evening a courtier was
hastily despatched to procure all the necessary
materials for making artificial flowers, that she
might learn the art at once. On another occasion
it was the desire to model in clay that must be
gratified on the spot.</p>
<p>Punctually at ten, a table was brought in with tea
and cakes, which the ladies served themselves, and
conversation now became general. Between eleven
and twelve the Empress withdrew to her own apartments
and generally retired at once though she
sometimes kept her reader, Mlle. Bouvet, to read
aloud to her after she was in bed. As a general
rule, however, she preferred to read to herself which
she did often and very rapidly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">Chapter IX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Eug&eacute;nie as a Leader of Fashion</span></h2>
<p>The stairways and corridors in the Tuileries
were so dark that they had to be lighted
summer and winter; and this, with the bad
ventilation, made the palace so unbearable in warm
weather that the court spent the summer months
away from Paris, at Fontainebleau, St. Cloud, or
Biarritz. Of these resorts Napoleon&rsquo;s favorite was
St. Cloud, where he usually went to recuperate
from the severe attacks of illness to which he was
subject. Here he was quite happy, playing with
his dog Nero, a faithful companion for many years,
or tending his roses in the palace garden.</p>
<p>Eug&eacute;nie, on her part, preferred Biarritz, in the
Pyrenees, and it was owing largely to her that this
resort became by far the most popular in France,
casting Dieppe, Trouville, and Boulogne completely
in the shade. Nowhere in the world could there
have been found such a medley of wealth and
poverty, aristocrats and adventurers, high-born dames
and demi-mondaines of all classes, as at Biarritz in
the days of the Second Empire. It had attractions
of all sorts, hotels and restaurants, shops and bazars
of every description, as well as a casino containing
a theatre, concert hall, ball and gaming rooms, from
the broad terrace of which there was a most charming
view.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>Opposite the town, on a rocky plateau across a
narrow arm of the sea, stood the Ch&acirc;teau Eug&eacute;nie.
It looked more like a barracks than a palace, and
owing to the salt spray flung all around it in time of
storm, no sort of vegetation would thrive there; but
when the Empress stepped out on her terrace in the
morning, the sea lay spread out at her feet. The
ever changing lights and shades of sky and water
lent variety to the solitary landscape; while looking
the other way she could watch the gay equipages
rolling by toward the baths. This to her was the
ideal combination of nature and civilization. In
this beautiful spot Eug&eacute;nie spent some of her happiest
hours, forgetful of the tedium of court life, her
husband&rsquo;s infidelities, and the persecutions of Prince
Napoleon and his followers. Here her natural high
spirits found vent, and she romped like a child with
her little son, or revelled in the sea-bathing, feeling
for the first time since her early youth the charms of
a life free from excitement or ambitious aims.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>Like all the children of Spain, she had the deepest
affection and reverence for her native land, that
land with which were connected so many happy as
well as painful memories, and where her mother still
lived. Now that her griefs had lost their sting, she
often longed for Spanish ways and customs and to
hear once more her childhood&rsquo;s tongue. From
Biarritz she could make frequent excursions into
Spain, where she hailed even the poorest peasants
with delight, chatting with them in their native language,
overwhelming them with gifts, and receiving
in return so warm a welcome that it more than repaid
her for all the humiliations of her youth. She also
visited Madrid, the scene of her early adventures,
and was received with the greatest distinction by
Queen Isabella, from whose court she had once been
dismissed on so slight a suspicion.</p>
<p>But it was not only in Spain that Eug&eacute;nie won all
hearts. Whether receiving royal guests or visiting
some charitable institution, presiding at court or
opening an exhibition, it could not be denied that
she had been wonderfully equipped by nature for
the great role she had been called upon to play on
the world&rsquo;s stage. Part of her popularity was also
due to the kindness of heart which was such a
conspicuous trait in her character through all her
changes of fortune. Many admirable institutions in
Paris owe their origin to the Empress Eug&eacute;nie&rsquo;s
benevolence. In the Summer of 1865, while acting
as Regent during the Emperor&rsquo;s stay in Algiers, she
devoted herself to improving conditions in the
reform schools for children. Accompanied by a
prefect of police she made a visit in person to &ldquo;La
Petite Roquette,&rdquo; a house of correction. A terrible
state of affairs existed in this institution, where,
since it was intended more for abandoned children
than those in need of punishment, a cell system had
been introduced to prevent communication between
the two classes. The dark court was also divided
by high walls; and here the five hundred wretched
inmates could be seen creeping about their cages like
wild beasts, with bowed heads and dull, vacant faces.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>The Empress&rsquo;s motherly heart overflowed with
pity at sight of these children&rsquo;s sufferings. She
appointed a commission at once to make a change
in this dreadful system and attended all the meetings,
which were held at the Tuileries, with the
greatest interest and enthusiasm. A member of
the commission took advantage of one of these
meetings to oppose the Empress&rsquo;s project. &ldquo;The
idea is all very well, Madame,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;but
there are so many obstacles in the way of its execution
that it is difficult to see how any remedy can
be provided. To discuss the question is merely an
excursion into the realm of sentiment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; replied the Empress gently, &ldquo;but
this is a question of humanity, not of politics.&rdquo; And
she finally carried her point. The youthful prisoners
of La Roquette were sent into the country,
and the cell system was abolished. It was not
without anxiety that the warders received the new
inmates, fearing it would be a hard task to manage
them and that the well-behaved children would be
corrupted by the others. Results proved, however,
that the Empress was right, for even the most depraved
and hardened culprits improved with kind
treatment and work in the open air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>Equally worthy of note was the day spent by the
Regent at St. Lazare&mdash;a place of confinement
for abandoned women. News of the Empress&rsquo;s
visit to this place spread like wildfire over the city,
and on leaving these poor, despised creatures she
received touching proofs of the people&rsquo;s devotion
to her. The crowds assembled in the streets murmured
blessings on her, while the women knelt to
kiss the hem of her gown.</p>
<p>Toward the end of September, 1865, cholera broke
out in Paris, and the court, which was then at
Biarritz, decided to return to the capital at once.
The memory of the terrible epidemic of 1849 was
still fresh in the minds of the people; and when,
after apparently subsiding, the disease broke out
again with renewed violence a terrible panic ensued.
The courage and self-sacrifice displayed by Eug&eacute;nie
during this time won universal applause; the newspapers,
even those hostile to her, were loud in praise
of the royal &ldquo;sister of charity.&rdquo; On the twenty-first
of October the Emperor made a long visit to
one of the cholera hospitals, and on leaving ordered
the sum of fifty thousand francs to be distributed
for the relief of the sufferers. Eug&eacute;nie, to whom
he had said nothing of his intention, was much disappointed
at not having accompanied him. The
next morning she drove from St. Cloud to Paris,
where she made the rounds of all the cholera hospitals
herself, going from bed to bed with words of
cheer and comfort. Once, pausing beside a man
who was dying, she took his hand in hers gently
and spoke some words of sympathy to him. Thinking
it one of the nuns, the poor fellow summoned up
his last remnants of strength to kiss her hand.
&ldquo;Thanks, sister,&rdquo; he murmured. The sister of charity
who accompanied the Empress leaned over and said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>&ldquo;You mistake, my friend; it was not I, but our
gracious Empress who spoke to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, sister,&rdquo; interposed Eug&eacute;nie, &ldquo;he
could have given me no more beautiful name&mdash;&ldquo; a
saying which was repeated and long remembered
among the people.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Yet much as Eug&eacute;nie had endeared herself to the
masses by her fearlessness and kind-heartedness
during the cholera epidemic, it was not long before
the feeling against her on account of her bigotry,
extravagance, and frivolity again came to the surface,
not alone in court circles but throughout the
whole Empire. To lay to the Empress&rsquo;s account
all the follies and indiscretions, all the worldliness
and self-seeking, of Parisian life at that time, would
be most unfair; yet it cannot be denied that her
influence had much to do with the luxury and the
eccentricities of fashion that prevailed. Doomed
by her rank to a life of idleness and inactivity, the
lack of proper food for heart and mind forced her
energies to find outlet in trifles. The gratification
of her vanity became the chief object of life. With
the sceptre of France, her slender hand also grasped
that of the world of fashion&mdash;a domain in which
she was no beneficent sovereign, but a tyrant whose
yoke was borne without a murmur. Even when she
was a young girl her costumes excited envy and
admiration for their originality, and at every watering-place
she visited, bungling imitations of the
beautiful Spaniard&rsquo;s <i>toilettes</i> were to be seen in
hotels and gaming halls. In Paris her influence soon
began to be felt, and almost before her name had
become familiar to the people her waistcoats were
being copied and sold by all the fashionable tailors,
and the high-heeled riding boots she had worn at
Compi&egrave;gne were adopted by every French court
lady. Every morning, as we have seen, before
going to mass, Eug&eacute;nie devoted one or two hours
at least to the study of dress.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>Her bedchamber, with its adjoining oratory, was
at some distance from her other apartments and
lacked all stamp of individuality. The bed, heavily
draped with rich hangings, was raised on a dais, and
resembled a throne. In this room she kept the
Golden Rose that was presented to her by the
Pope, and beside the bed stood one of the palm
branches sent her each year by the Holy Father
with his blessing. Yet here she spent far less time
during the day than in the dressing-room next it,
where there were several large movable mirrors
enabling her to see herself from all points. On the
floor above, connected by elevator and speaking
tube with her private apartments, were the rooms
occupied by her waiting-women. Here was a vast
store of silks, velvets, and satins, with gowns and
every conceivable article of wearing apparel. Ranged
along the wall were rows of dresses and wraps of
all sorts and colors, with receptacles for hats, shoes,
fans, parasols, etc. In one of the rooms were several
life-sized forms which the Empress had had made,
exactly reproducing her own figure in size and
height, and dressed like living women to the smallest
detail; for in spite of the pains taken by the modistes
and tailors to win her approval, it was seldom that
a costume entirely suited her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>She was tireless in her quest for novelty. With
each change of season, quantities of models and
materials were brought to her to choose from, and
numberless conferences were held with Madame
Virot, the court milliner, as well as Worth, the
famous ladies&rsquo; tailor, whose reputation she founded.
He would often send her costumes costing one or
two hundred thousand francs, and once he made her
pay as much as fifty thousand francs for a simple
cloak. Even these works of art met with no mercy
in their original form, but were always remodelled
and altered according to her orders, until her own
carefully cultivated taste produced the desired
effect of perfect harmony. All the artistic talent
she possessed was devoted to the study of dress, and
under her sway fashion rose into the realm of art.
Inseparable from the image of the beautiful Spaniard
is the energy with which for eighteen long years
she wielded its sceptre. Her greatest interest in
life, it constituted at once her strength and her
weakness&mdash;weakness because from it sprang the
charge of folly and extravagance justly made by
France against its former sovereign; strength, because
of the art with which it enabled her to hold
her place on the pedestal to which she had been
elevated, and gave her the power to dazzle and fascinate
not only the masses but also her equals and
contemporaries.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="h2line1">Chapter X</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Decline of the Empire</span></h2>
<p>As yet there had been no sign of change in
Eug&eacute;nie&rsquo;s fortunes. The sun of empire
was still apparently at its zenith. France
deemed herself invincible. The throne seemed
secured to the present dynasty for all time. The
Emperor&rsquo;s policy had received some severe blows,
however, and disquieting rumors floated over from
the ill-fated Empire he had founded in Mexico.</p>
<p>Maximilian and Carlotta had often visited the
Tuileries in their younger days, and it was only by
Napoleon&rsquo;s urgent persuasion and promise of support
until his throne should be firmly established that the
Austrian Archduke consented to accept the fatal
crown. Mindful of this promise, in his hour of
need Maximilian sent his wife to Europe to seek
Napoleon&rsquo;s aid. She arrived in Paris at night, and
without pausing a moment to rest after the long
wearisome sea voyage she hastened to St. Cloud,
her disordered dress and distracted appearance betraying
her terrible agitation. She had brought over
the letters Napoleon had written to her husband,
promising his support. Handing these to the Emperor,
she flung herself at his feet imploring him to
keep his word. But all in vain. Even had he
wished, he could have done nothing; and sobbing
aloud, half senseless with despair, Carlotta is said
to have left St. Cloud with a curse on her lips,
crying: &ldquo;Louis Philippe&rsquo;s granddaughter should
never have trusted her fate to a Bonaparte!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>But although Napoleon&rsquo;s political errors began to
darken the halo lent him by the Crimean War, and
although two important events in the world&rsquo;s history
had occurred without his having any share in them
(the wars between Denmark and Germany in 1864,
and between Prussia and Austria in 1866), to all
appearances the period immediately succeeding was
marked by greater splendor and prosperity than
ever. On the first of April, 1867, a second World&rsquo;s
Exposition was opened in Paris. Once more a
stream of people from all parts of the world poured
into the capital. Never in the history of France
had such lavish hospitality been displayed&mdash;not
even during the magnificence of Louis the Fourteenth&rsquo;s
time nor in the reign of Napoleon the First.
A perfect galaxy of crowned heads was assembled
at the French court, and the proudest princesses,
the most conservative monarchs, vied with one another
in marks of friendship toward &ldquo;the upstart&rdquo;
and &ldquo;the adventuress.&rdquo; And with what matchless
grace, with what admirable tact, Eug&eacute;nie played the
part of hostess to her illustrious guests!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>In consequence of an attempt to assassinate the
Czar of Russia, history has preserved an account of
the grand military review that was held on the
seventh of June, 1867, in his honor and that of the
King of Prussia. Living walls of spectators surrounded
the plain of Longchamps where it took place.
The glitter of uniforms, the flash of arms, and the
flutter of banners made a brilliant scene in the summer
sunshine. The guests arrived in state and took
their places. The Crown Princess of Prussia and her
sister Princess Alice of Hesse were already in their
seats on the tribune, but no one heeded them. A
general air of expectancy prevailed. Suddenly on
all sides arose the shout, &ldquo;Here comes the Empress!&rdquo;
and beaming with happiness, smiling and bowing
graciously to all, Eug&eacute;nie drove round the great
plain through ranks of cheering thousands and
alighted at the imperial pavilion. Directly behind
her came the three monarchs on horseback, followed
by the German Crown Prince and the Russian
heir to the throne, while the massed troops
presented arms and a blare of trumpets greeted
Their Majesties. Eug&eacute;nie took the seat of honor
on the tribune, her glance travelling proudly over
the glittering ranks of soldiers, the flower of the
French army, and the shouting throngs beyond. As
the sovereigns approached, Alexander of Russia and
William the Great of Prussia rode up and bent to
kiss her hand. The granddaughter of the wine-merchant
Kirkpatrick, daughter of Manuela Montijo of
doubtful reputation, receiving public homage from
Europe&rsquo;s mightiest princes&mdash;well might Eug&eacute;nie be
proud and happy!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>The review at Longchamps was one of the last of
those brilliant spectacles that amazed the world
during the Second Empire, although not the last of
Eug&eacute;nie&rsquo;s triumphs that memorable summer. Three
weeks later the exposition prizes were awarded by
the Prince Imperial, officiating as President, on which
occasion were present the Prince of Wales, the Crown
Princess of Prussia, the Crown Prince of Italy, the
Duke of Aosta, the Grand Duchess Marie of Russia,
and lastly the Sultan, with his son and two nephews.
Side by side on the magnificently decorated platform
sat Christian and Mohammedan, the bigoted
Empress and the Turkish Sultan. He had no command
of French, but the glances with which he followed
her every motion plainly spoke the language
of admiration. Intoxicated with gratified vanity
and ambition, Eug&eacute;nie believed herself at the summit
of her greatness; but already the ground was
trembling beneath her feet. On that very day
Napoleon received news of Maximilian&rsquo;s tragic fate,
and the shouts of the populace were powerless to
drown the echoes of the rattle of musketry that
came to him from Quer&eacute;taro like a prophecy of evil.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>One of Napoleon&rsquo;s most marked and singular characteristics
was his firm belief in predestination. It
was this fatalism that had led him to centre all his
energies on winning the throne, and to it he also
owed his cool personal bravery. With this indifference
to danger were linked the irresolution and
vacillation so conspicuous in all the political dealings
of his later years. He tried in every possible way
to lift the veil that hid the future. There was
scarcely a fortune-teller of any repute in Paris whom
he did not secretly visit, and, incredible as it may
seem, their prophecies always made a deep impression
on him.</p>
<p>It had often been foretold him, even before he
ascended the throne, that Germany would be the
cause of his undoing, and that was the reason why
he could neither bring himself to support national
unity in that country nor yet decide forcibly to
oppose it. He had hoped the war between Prussia
and Austria would weaken both powers so that he
might be able to snatch the roast chestnuts safely
from the fire; but Prussia&rsquo;s decisive victory left him
helpless and irresolute, unable to nerve himself to
any decisive action. The increasing power of that
country caused a growing uneasiness throughout
France, and the Emperor&rsquo;s credit began to sink. He
tried to form new political alliances, but it seemed
as if the hand of fate, which at first had led him on
from victory to victory, was now against him, for
he encountered only difficulties and disappointments.
To play the role of protector to the Latin
peoples had always been a part of Napoleon the
Third&rsquo;s policy. It was no slight blow to him, therefore,
when Isabella of Spain, with whom he was
about to form an alliance, was dethroned just as a
meeting between them had been arranged. She
sought refuge in Paris, where she was received with
royal honors, and her son, afterwards King Alfonso
the Twelfth, became the constant playmate of the
Prince Imperial.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>The revolution beyond the Pyrenees sounded the
alarm for France, and clouds of insurrection began
to appear on the horizon. Napoleon found himself
forced to loosen the reins of government; and
although the disturbances apparently blew over,
opposition increased daily. With modification of
the press laws in 1867 the situation grew worse
instead of better; and when in the following year
Henri Rochefort began the publication of &ldquo;La
Lanterne,&rdquo; the waves of revolution began to rise.
This democratic Comte exercised a magical influence
over public opinion in Paris, and his scurrilous
journal, filled with venomous attacks on the whole
imperial family, reached an enormous circulation.
Napoleon&rsquo;s political blunders were not calculated
to appease popular sentiment or his own anxious
forebodings. To add to his troubles, he suffered
greatly from a chronic physical ailment; and in the
autumn of 1869 his health was so seriously affected
that there was some talk of declaring the Prince
Imperial of age, before the proper time. Eug&eacute;nie&rsquo;s
popularity too began to wane even among the middle
classes, which had always formed her strongest
support.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>As every one knows, it was her cousin Ferdinand
de Lesseps who was the originator of the Suez Canal.
With it his name will remain forever linked, while
the Empress&rsquo;s share in this undertaking will doubtless
soon be forgotten. He conceived the idea during
a long residence in Egypt, and devoted a year
of tireless labor to its execution; but it was her enthusiastic
support that encouraged and urged him
on and paved the way for his success. It was not
all smooth sailing, however. Before the canal was
finished rumors arose that it would not be navigable
for large vessels. The stock fell heavily; and with
their usual fickleness, the French people, threatened
with heavy losses, blamed the Empress, who had
done her best to encourage subscription to the stock.
Instead of the shouts that usually greeted her appearance
she encountered only an ominous silence;
and so great was her unpopularity at this time, that
she found it advisable when at the theatre to retire
to the back of her box. Her desire to be present
at the opening of the Suez Canal added fuel to the
flame. One day it was announced by telegraph
from London that Napoleon had negotiated a loan
of ten million francs from English banks to defray
the expenses of his wife&rsquo;s journey to Egypt. Of
course it was totally without foundation, but the
radical press hastened to spread the report with so
many malicious additions that Eug&eacute;nie was universally
denounced for the vast sums she was supposed
to have squandered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>Arrangements for her journey were continued,
nevertheless. Preparations were made everywhere
to receive the fair guest on so grand a scale that it
is well worth a glance backward to recall the homage
paid her so short a time before her fall. Venice,
where the imperial yacht, the <i>Eagle</i>, first touched,
was beautifully illuminated. The Italian royal
family welcomed her in person; and a hundred
singers serenaded her on the Grand Canal. In
Athens she met with a still more flattering reception;
but it was at Constantinople that the most
elaborate preparations had been made in her honor.
All the streets through which she was to pass were
newly paved and a number of houses torn down that
they might be widened. Accommodations for twenty
thousand troops were erected, and near by, a splendid
kiosk. A gorgeous sedan chair valued at over
two hundred thousand francs was made expressly
for her use, while for weeks the ladies of the harem
were busy practising their curtsies and wearing
high-heeled shoes. On the arrival of the <i>Eagle</i>,
October 13, 1869, she was met by a fleet of twenty
vessels, which escorted her through a double line of
Turkish men-of-war, twenty-five on either side, each
of which saluted with a hundred and one guns, the
imperial yacht responding with an equal number.
The shores of the Bosphorus were lined on both sides
with troops. All the ships in the harbor were decorated
with flags, and at the appointed landing-place
the Sultan was waiting to receive his royal guest.
The event was made a national holiday. All the
provinces and dependencies of the Turkish Empire
sent deputations to the capital to greet the French
Empress; public celebrations of all kinds were held;
and at night the illuminations on the Bosphorus
were a magnificent sight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>A week later Eug&eacute;nie reached Alexandria on her
triumphal progress, where she was welcomed by
Ismail, the Viceroy of Egypt, and from whence the
journey was continued by rail to Cairo. Everywhere
her appearance was the signal for an unbroken succession
of <i>f&ecirc;tes</i> and illuminations. At the celebration
of the opening of the Canal her yacht was the
first to pass through it. Seated on the flower-wreathed
deck, amid the thunder of cannon and
strains of music from all the ships&rsquo; bands, she sailed
proudly through the new waterway, not only France&rsquo;s
sovereign and the patroness of the great undertaking,
but Queen of Beauty and Fashion as well. Almost
all the great sea powers were represented at the
ceremony. The Emperor of Austria and the Crown
Prince of Prussia with many other royalties were
with her on the <i>Eagle</i>, but it was upon Eug&eacute;nie that
all eyes were fixed; for her the frantic shouts that
rent the air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The War of 1870</span></h2>
<p>The spirit of revolution may be quenched at
times in the populace of Paris, but it is
never entirely extinguished. Napoleon the
Third had held their turbulence in check for nearly
twenty years, but now all signs seemed to indicate
that an outbreak was imminent. The Emperor&rsquo;s
best friends advised him to identify himself with
the liberal party, which in case of any change of
sovereignty would prove a valuable safeguard to
his young and inexperienced son. Others were of
the opinion that a war with Prussia was necessary
to preserve the Empire and revive popular loyalty
to the name of Napoleon. That such a war would
at one blow shatter the proud imperial edifice, no
one dreamed, least of all the Empress, who was at
the head of this party.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>Napoleon chose the former course. At the general
election of 1870, the change from an autocratic to
a constitutional government was approved by about
eight million votes. For the other alternative he
had a decided distaste. His watchword, &ldquo;empire
is peace,&rdquo; was no empty phrase on his lips, in spite
of the wars into which he had been forced by policy.
When at the victorious battle of Solferino he saw
whole ranks of Austrians mowed down by his artillery,
he ordered the firing to cease, in spite of the
protests of his officers; and long afterwards he could
never think or speak of this bloody engagement
without a shudder. One of his most cherished plans
was to bring about a general disarmament of all the
great powers, and a presentiment that his ruin was
near at hand made him the more averse to any conflict
with Prussia. The pressure in favor of it grew
steadily greater, however, and, weary of the burden
of government, ill in body and mind, he finally
yielded. War was declared on the most trivial
pretext, July 14, 1870.</p>
<p>Heretofore the French people had shown no special
interest in the subject, and the news came as a surprise;
yet once the die was cast, the prospect of war
excited the wildest enthusiasm. The Emperor and
Empress were greeted with acclamation: the horses
were taken from their coach and drawn by the youth
of France; the imperial pair rode in triumph through
the streets of Paris. The whole nation was aroused.
Volunteers flocked to the banner of France. Shouts
of, &ldquo;To Berlin! To Berlin!&rdquo; and the strains of the
Marseillaise, filled the air. The ferment that had
long been brewing having now found an outlet, the
riotous element hastened to the frontier. Every
day fresh bodies of troops departed. Paris was in
high spirits, and news from the seat of war was
awaited with confident assurance. From day to
day it was expected that the Emperor would join the
army; but it was not till the twenty-eighth of July
that he finally took his departure, leaving his wife
as Regent during his absence, and accompanied by
the Prince Imperial, who was to have his first experience
of warfare.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>When Napoleon questioned Leb&oelig;uf, the Minister
of War, concerning the preparations for war, he was
assured that all was complete. The army was ready;
everything in order, to the smallest detail. Yet how
far from truth, alas, were these empty phrases!
Reforms that had been begun under the preceding
ministry were far from being carried out. Army
organization was wofully defective. Even so important
a post as Metz was insufficiently protected.
Contractors defrauded the Government. All was
confusion and lack of proper equipment. Under
these conditions it is not strange that the overthrow
of the Germans did not speedily follow. After some
delay&mdash;far too long to suit the eager Parisians&mdash;came
the first despatch, a message of victory. The
indecisive action at Saarbr&uuml;cken was construed into
a glorious beginning of the war. The Emperor&rsquo;s
telegram to his wife was printed all over Europe
and stamped the Prince Imperial with an impression
of ridicule that only his life-blood, afterwards shed
at Itelezi, was able entirely to obliterate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Louis has received his baptism of fire. He showed
admirable calmness and did not once lose his composure.
One of General Frossard&rsquo;s divisions has taken the heights
overlooking Saarbr&uuml;cken on the left. Prussia will offer
little resistance. We were at the front, with musket and
cannon balls falling all about us. Louis has kept a bullet
that struck close beside him. One of the soldiers wept
to see him so brave. Our total loss amounts to one
officer and ten men.</p>
<p><span class="jr">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Napoleon.</span>&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This news was received with satisfaction but
neither surprise nor enthusiasm. It was no more
than was expected, and even in France there was
much laughter over Lulu&rsquo;s &ldquo;baptism of fire.&rdquo; But
soon came a change. The German victories of
Weissenburg, W&ouml;rth, and Forbach followed in
rapid succession. At the French headquarters an
attempt was made to suppress the news of these
defeats and no word from the seat of war was
received in Paris. The ministers who went to St.
Cloud to consult with the Empress found her in
tears, and full of anxiety at the long silence. At
length, however, rumors of the disasters reached
the capital, and the people were beside themselves
with rage and despair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>Early on the morning of Sunday, the seventh of
August, the Empress came to Paris and immediately
sent for the ministers and the presidents of the
Legislative Assembly and the Senate. The next
day Paris was declared in a state of siege and a proclamation
issued by the Empress, urging the citizens
to maintain order and rally to the support of France
that her losses might be retrieved. She already
imagined herself at the head of affairs, taking active
measures for the defence of the capital, cheering on
the troops, and firing them with courage, a role that
particularly appealed to her fancy; but the appeal
made little impression. The people, only too
familiar with her fondness for theatrical effect and
admiration, clamored for action. Declamation was
little to the purpose. They wanted victories, not
comedies!</p>
<p>Public irritation vented itself first of all against the
ministry, which was forced to resign. &Eacute;mile Ollivier
was succeeded by the aged General Montauban,
Count of Palikao, who had distinguished himself in the
war against China; while Trochu was appointed Governor
of Paris. Further to satisfy popular sentiment,
Napoleon was forced to resign his position as Generalissimo
in favor of Marshal Bazaine, who accordingly
assumed the chief command of the army.</p>
<p>Under normal conditions the Emperor&rsquo;s place
would now have been in Paris; but the new ministry,
as well as the Empress herself, protested
against his return. Disheartened by the long delays,
sore with disappointed hopes, and furious at
the supposed mistakes of the generals, the people
of Paris were ripe for revolution, and only a spark
was needed to set them aflame. The imperial
pair were overwhelmed with scorn and abuse. Already
their throne was tottering, and with the victorious
advance of the Germans, conviction of its
speedy downfall grew daily stronger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>Never before had the Empress found herself in
so critical a situation. The new ministry lacked
the confidence of the public and could be of no help
to her. She had no tried general to depend upon,
and every trace of the troops&rsquo; devotion to the house
of Napoleon had long since vanished. She stood
alone and defenceless against an enraged populace
only awaiting a pretext to hurl itself upon her.
With this daily-increasing excitement, the brawls
and dissensions caused by the army&rsquo;s defeats on the
frontier, and universal anxiety for the fate of the
country, Eug&eacute;nie began to understand how grievously
she had erred in urging on this &ldquo;little war,&rdquo;
as she had referred to it in the beginning of the campaign.
Fears as to the fate of her own husband and
child made her realize for the first time the suffering
of thousands of other wives and mothers. She felt
the necessity of uniting with them in some active
work, and was tireless in her efforts to atone in some
measure for the wrong she had thoughtlessly committed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>In the days of prosperity her worst qualities had
been uppermost; she had not shown the better
side of her nature. It remained for misfortune to
reveal her real strength and nobility of character.
In spite of the feeling against her, she went about
everywhere, personally superintending the care of
the wounded. The brilliant salons of the Tuileries
were turned into hospital wards. A new spirit
seemed to animate her and to lend her fresh strength
in this time of danger. At night she rarely slept,
and even when taking a brief rest during the day,
her attendants had orders to awaken her the moment
any message or despatch arrived. No matter how
worn out or exhausted she might be, she would force
herself to rise and hasten back to the bedside of the
wounded where there was so much suffering to relieve,
though she had no time to think of her own misery.
Yet often in her own chamber, haunted by the agonized
cries of the dying, she would pace up and down
wringing her hands as if in bodily pain, tortured by
anguish of soul. In these hours she prayed long and
fervently for her dear ones and for her people, the
women who suffered like herself, the brave men who
were fighting for their country. A feverish activity
possessed her. She tried to persuade Austria to
assist France. She wrote to the Queen of England
imploring her to intervene for the sake of peace.
She pardoned over two thousand criminals. She
superintended the preparations for the defence of
Paris and held innumerable consultations with
Trochu, in whom she placed the blindest and most
implicit confidence. At the same time, however,
she took the precaution of having all her important
private and family papers conveyed on board the
French squadron, as well as some of the principal
works of art from the Louvre. She also had a
list of the crown jewels made, to secure her against
suspicion in case of extremity. Her own personal
ornaments were sent to her mother in Spain. The
strain and over-exertion of these weeks seriously
affected her health and wrought a startling change
in her appearance. Tortured with suspense, she
waited from day to day for news from the seat of
war; yet all that came brought so little comfort
that her advisers thought best to conceal it from the
people as far as possible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>At length came the final blow. On the afternoon
of the third of September, as the Minister of Foreign
Affairs was on his way to the Tuileries, he was met
by the Superintendent of Telegraphs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have just received a most important telegram
for the Empress from the Emperor,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
usually attend myself to the messages that pass
between Their Majesties, but this one I have not
the courage to deliver.&rdquo; It was the well-known
despatch:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The army is defeated and has surrendered. I myself
am a prisoner.</p>
<p><span class="jr">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Napoleon.</span>&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>The Minister went at once to Eug&eacute;nie with this
terrible news, the reality of which exceeded all that
her darkest fears had painted, and her feelings at
this moment may be better imagined than described.
Yet even then she did not consider her own fate.
Her only thought was for France; and she firmly
refused to employ the troops in her own defence
against the people, for that would have added the
terrors of civil strife to those of war. Late that
evening the bad news reached the city, but instead
of uniting to make a brave stand against the enemy,
the populace rose in arms, and it was plain that the
Empire&rsquo;s days were numbered. The streets were
filled with surging throngs, shouting &ldquo;Down with
the Emperor! Down with the Empress! Long
live the Republic!&rdquo; On all sides was heard the
expression, &ldquo;An Emperor dies, but does not surrender.&rdquo;</p>
<p>About one o&rsquo;clock that night the Legislature held
a special session. Not a member was absent, and
the galleries were crowded. Amid a deathly silence
the president arose. He said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A calamity has brought us together here at this
unwonted hour. I have called the session to discuss
our present situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not a sound broke the stillness. All eyes were
fixed on the Ministers&rsquo; bench. Count Palikao rose.
The aged hero was no orator, but his voice was firm
as he announced the disaster of Sedan. He added,
slowly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;With such news it is impossible for the ministry
to enter into any discussion before to-morrow. I
was called from my bed only a short time since, to
come here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>The president of the Exchequer then put the
question as to whether the meeting should be adjourned.
&ldquo;Aye-aye,&rdquo; shouted several voices. Suddenly
a bushy head arose, and a loud, discordant
voice made three motions:&mdash;&ldquo;Deposition of the
Emperor; Appointment of a provisional Government;
Retention of Trochu as Governor of Paris.&rdquo;
It was Jules Favre.</p>
<p>Only members of the Extreme Left subscribed to
these motions, which were received with surprising
indifference. One member of the Right protested
against the Emperor&rsquo;s deposition, but an ominous
silence greeted his words. For the rest of the night
a similar silence reigned throughout the city. It
was the hush before the storm.</p>
<p>That Eug&eacute;nie was far from suspecting an uprising
is shown by the fact that she made absolutely no
preparations for flight. The next morning she arose
early, heard mass in her private chapel, and made
her rounds of the hospitals as usual. At nine o&rsquo;clock
she received General Trochu, who, although only a
few hours since placed at the head of the new Government,
still solemnly protested his loyalty to her.
Later in the forenoon a deputation waited on the
Regent to inform her of the appointment of a commission
to assume control of the Government in
her place, in other words, to request her resignation.
She listened quietly to their explanation and dismissed
them with the following words:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>&ldquo;What you mean to offer me, gentlemen, is the
pledge of a peaceful future, on condition that I
renounce the present and abandon in time of danger
the post entrusted to me. That I cannot do. To
such terms I certainly will not subscribe. Go back
to the Assembly and say to General Palikao and
his colleagues that I rely upon them implicitly;
that I grant them full power to take any steps proper
for the interest of the country, and approve the same
in advance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile the public tumult increased in violence.
The red flag was hoisted everywhere. A boy of
nine years even climbed up and fastened one to the
top of the bronze railing that surrounded the Tuileries.
Thousands filled the Place de la Concorde,
roaring the Marseillaise at the top of their voices.
The Assembly had again met, but so many forced
their way into the chamber, and the uproar was so
great, that it was impossible to transact any business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not here shall the Republic be proclaimed,&rdquo;
shouted Gambetta, &ldquo;but at the H&ocirc;tel de Ville!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This suggestion met with great applause, and the
deputies adjourned to that edifice, where a Government
of National Defence was formed. The
news that the Empire no longer existed quickly
spread and was hailed with wildest enthusiasm.
Not a voice was raised in behalf of the fallen dynasty.
Vast throngs invaded the H&ocirc;tel de Ville and valuable
portraits of the Emperor and Empress were hacked
with knives, trampled under foot, and tossed out
of the windows. The imperial emblems were torn
to pieces, and the eagle, which could not be easily
removed, was covered with paper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>&ldquo;At the windows of the huge barracks filled with
troops supposed to be loyal unto death to the Emperor,&rdquo;
says an eye-witness, &ldquo;I saw soldiers laughing,
waving their handkerchiefs, and shouting &lsquo;Long
live the Republic!&rsquo; Strangers hugged and kissed
one another for joy. In the neighborhood of the
Pont Neuf, people mounted on high ladders were
busy pulling down busts of the Emperor, which
were carried in mock state and flung into the Seine,
shouts of laughter and applause greeting the splash
with which the mutilated images of their former
sovereign struck the water.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Eug&eacute;nie&rsquo;s Flight to England</span></h2>
<p>The Empress mean while was still at the Tuileries.
One of the palace prefects had returned
from the Assembly with news of what
had passed, but she refused to desert her post even
though the mob was already at the gates of the
palace and a dull roar penetrated the deserted halls.
Eug&eacute;nie&rsquo;s question as to whether it would be possible
to defend the Tuileries without bloodshed was
answered in the negative by the governor of the
palace, General Mellinet, and she still refused to
have a drop of blood shed in her behalf. Nearer
and nearer sounded the uproar, and the trampling
of feet was now distinctly audible. Shouts were
heard: &ldquo;She will escape!&rdquo; &ldquo;Long live the Republic!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Down with the Spaniard!&rdquo; &ldquo;Forward! Into
the palace&mdash;forward!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>Prince Metternich and the Italian ambassador,
Count Nigra, who had hastened to the side of the
Empress, urged her to flee, as every moment that
passed made escape more difficult. But to run
away from danger was foreign to Eug&eacute;nie&rsquo;s nature,
and she could not bring herself to believe it necessary,
in spite of the raging mob without trampling on one
another, swaying now forward, now back, striving
with shrieks and blows to make room and force open
the gates of the palace, all animated by a single
impulse&mdash;hatred for the imperial house. At length
sounds of tumult were heard on the great staircase,
and the Empress&rsquo;s attendants implored her to leave
the palace and not expose their lives to danger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there no other way?&rdquo; she asked in despair.
&ldquo;Is there nothing we can do to defend ourselves?
At least, you can say I have done my duty to the
last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Deeply moved, they kissed her hand without
replying; but the Prince urged them to hurry, as
there was no time to lose. A dark cloak was thrown
around the Empress, and, accompanied by her
reader, Madame Lebreton, with the two ambassadors,
Minister Chevreau, and a few members of her
court, she consented at last to go. Escape was impossible
through the palace courtyard; for the Place
du Carrousel, from which it was separated only by
a slender railing, was packed with people. Some
other way must be found; but before leaving her
rooms Eug&eacute;nie went to the window and stood looking
down for a moment on the seething mass below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;what folly to spend their
strength in this way, when the enemy is at the gates!&rdquo;
Then, as she turned to go, she added with emotion:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unhappy palace! fate seems to have ordained
that all crowned heads shall leave you in this way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>By this time her escort was reduced to the two
ambassadors and Madame Lebreton. The others
had already fled to seek their own safety. She took
Count Nigra&rsquo;s arm, and Madame Lebreton followed
with Prince Metternich. Through the Flora Pavilion
of the Tuileries they hurried to the Louvre,
the galleries of which they must traverse at full
length to reach an exit on the side toward St.
Germain. But here, too, the street was crowded
with people shouting, &ldquo;Long live the Republic!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Down with the Emperor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little party halted before the door, but behind
them also sounded the roar of the mob. To turn
back would be inevitably to fall into their hands.
The risk must be taken; there was nothing to do
but go on. Even at this critical point the Empress&rsquo;s
courage did not forsake her; indeed, she had never
given clearer proof of it than now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are holding my arm,&rdquo; she said to Nigra;
&ldquo;do you feel it tremble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the least, Madame,&rdquo; replied the Count.</p>
<p>The gentlemen opened the doors. The ladies
passed out, and Eug&eacute;nie found herself face to face
with the populace who were inflamed with hatred
against her. She was within a hair&rsquo;s-breadth of
sharing the fate of Marie Antoinette, or perhaps
being torn to pieces by the rabble. The excitement
was so great, there is no knowing what terrible scene
might have been enacted had she been recognized.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>Luckily a closed carriage happened to be standing
near by, and with great presence of mind she rushed
toward it. A street urchin spied her and shouted,
&ldquo;Look, look! the Empress!&rdquo; but no one heeded the
words. Nigra stopped and spoke to the boy to divert
his attention while Eug&eacute;nie threw herself into the
carriage, followed by Madame Lebreton. Prince
Metternich shouted an imaginary address to the
driver, and off they went, safe at least for the time
being. But their troubles were not yet ended. In
her haste, Eug&eacute;nie had forgotten her purse; and when
her companion drew hers from her pocket she found
to her horror that it contained only three francs in
all, scarcely enough to pay for the carriage. To
avoid a discussion with the driver, they determined
to continue on foot, but whither, they had not yet
considered. At the Boulevard Haussmann, therefore,
they alighted, and while Madame Lebreton
paid the coachman, Eug&eacute;nie stepped into the shadow
of a doorway.</p>
<p>It is said that the Empress knocked in vain at
many doors before she succeeded in finding a temporary
asylum in her own capital; but at length the
happy thought occurred to her of applying to Dr.
Evans, a well-known American dentist whom she
had known for years and often received at the Tuileries.
Arrived at his office, she had to wait with
other patients in the anteroom till her turn came;
but at last Madame Lebreton was able to gain admittance
to the dentist and told him that the Empress
was without, hoping to find a refuge under his
roof until she could make her escape from Paris.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>Evans&rsquo;s astonishment was beyond words. Unaware
as yet of the sudden change in affairs, he could
not believe it possible that the Empress should have
cause to fear for her safety. Nevertheless he begged
the ladies to wait while he went out into the street
to convince himself of the true condition of things.
In a short time he returned, convinced that they had
not left the Tuileries a moment too soon; and without
a thought of his own danger or the possible
detriment to his business, he promised to aid them
to the full extent of his power. His wife was away
at the time, and as luck would have it, he was expecting
the arrival that day of two patients who
were unknown to his servants. He now introduced
the Empress and Madame Lebreton as these persons.
His own bedchamber was prepared for Eug&eacute;nie and
an improvised couch placed in it for her companion.</p>
<p>While the Empress was thus being harbored in the
house of the chivalrous American, and full of anxiety
as to what the morrow would bring forth, all Paris
was mad with joy. Men, women, and children
marched up and down the streets all night, singing
and shouting, oblivious of the disaster of Sedan
and the country&rsquo;s danger, and rejoicing that the
Empire was no more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>Evans, meanwhile, had instantly set to work.
Under pretext of a professional visit, but in reality
to prepare for the Empress&rsquo;s escape, he drove out
that very day to the Neuilly Bridge where he was
stopped and asked to give his name, also his destination
and his errand. One of the guards who happened
to know him, however, called to his comrade
to let the American pass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may be frequently obliged to pass the barriers,&rdquo;
remarked the Doctor coolly; &ldquo;look well at me, my
man, so that you will know me again and that I
may not be detained unnecessarily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His plan was already made. On his return he
informed the ladies that they would be able to pass
the Neuilly Bridge the next day under his protection
if Her Majesty would consent to play the part
of a mad woman. He would pretend to have a
patient with him on her way to an asylum beyond
Neuilly, while Madame Lebreton could pass as her
attendant. Accompanied by a friend and countryman
of Dr. Evans, who was taken into their confidence,
they started off the next morning. All went
well. The sentry at once recognized the doctor,
while the Empress, leaning back in the carriage, her
face hidden by a thick veil, passed unnoticed. This
danger past, they reached St. Germain in safety,
and then Nantes, where they put up at an inn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a lady with me whom I am taking to a
private asylum,&rdquo; Evans explained to the innkeeper,
&ldquo;and I would like a quiet room with shutters on the
windows.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>His request was complied with without question,
and here Eug&eacute;nie and her companion were able to
enjoy a few hours&rsquo; rest. Evans&rsquo;s colleague returned
to Paris with the doctor&rsquo;s carriage which they had
used thus far, and a coach was hired for them by
the landlord to convey the invalid to the institution
where she was to be left in charge. Further to carry
out the plan, it was privately arranged that the
Empress should appear to protest against being
taken there, and make such forcible resistance on
the way that they would apparently be forced to
take another road. They had driven for scarcely
half an hour, therefore, when a loud dispute arose
between Eug&eacute;nie and the doctor, which became so
violent that Evans called to the coachman to stop
that he might try and induce the patient to go a
short distance on foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not&mdash;I will not!&rdquo; stormed the Empress,
and her screams frightened the horses so that the
driver declared he would go no further unless the
disturbance was stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will never go to that place, I will not!&rdquo; shrieked
Eug&eacute;nie afresh, and at last there seemed nothing
for it but to turn back and drive to the nearest post
station, whence the coach was sent back. As a
further measure of precaution they changed conveyances
at every station, now, however, taking the
road to their real destination&mdash;the watering-place
of Deauville, where Mrs. Evans was then staying.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>For many weeks, as we have seen, Eug&eacute;nie had
lived in constant agitation and anxiety&mdash;the days
full of exhausting labor, the nights without sleep&mdash;and
had suffered both mentally and physically in
consequence. She was no longer able to eat, and
had lived for the last four or five days literally on
nothing but black coffee and chloral, which she had
been in the habit of taking in large quantities to
drown her troubles. She wept almost incessantly;
and even when sleep lent her a few moments&rsquo; respite,
she would start up suddenly, begin to talk and laugh
excitedly, then as quickly burst into tears and relapse
again into deepest melancholy.</p>
<p>After two seemingly endless days, the fugitives
reached Deauville on the evening of September 6,
and Evans took the Empress and her companion
at once to his wife. Mrs. Evans was about the
same size as Eug&eacute;nie, and gladly packed up a part of
her wardrobe with some necessary articles of toilet
for the Empress&rsquo;s use, while the doctor hastened
to discover what boats were leaving for England.
Two vessels were in the harbor, the larger an American
ship, the other a pleasure yacht, the <i>Gazelle</i>,
belonging to Lord Burgoyne. Finding the former
not sufficiently seaworthy, Evans applied to Lord
Burgoyne, who at first flatly refused to take the
Empress across, partly for political reasons, partly
because a storm was brewing. But Eug&eacute;nie&rsquo;s protector
insisted so urgently that he finally yielded on
condition that the ladies should not come aboard till
just before the boat sailed, lest the fact that he had
passengers should attract attention. Shortly before
midnight Eug&eacute;nie, accompanied by Evans and her
faithful Lebreton, hurried on board the yacht, which
did not weigh anchor, however, till the next morning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>The dangers by land now lay behind the fugitives,
but others still awaited them by sea. Soon a fearful
storm arose, and the little craft was tossed about
at the mercy of the elements. The crew, little suspecting
that an Empress looked to them for rescue,
labored on bravely and calmly, as is the way of
sailors, who know at any moment they may be
called into eternity. Still the storm increased in
violence, and the danger grew greater every moment.
The ladies were flung about the tiny cabin like bales
of merchandise. By nightfall all hope seemed
vanished. Pale as death, terror stamped on every
line of his countenance, Lord Burgoyne appeared
at the door of the cabin, crying that they were lost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all your fault!&rdquo; he shouted, glaring wildly
at the doctor, then rushed away as suddenly as he
had come. The three passengers looked at one another
in amazement, and seasick, exhausted, and
disheartened as she was, Eug&eacute;nie could not help
laughing at the Englishman&rsquo;s frenzy of terror. Still
the brave little <i>Gazelle</i> struggled on against wind
and wave until at last the storm began to subside,
and about three o&rsquo;clock the next morning, after what
seemed a miraculous escape, they reached the harbor
of Ryde on the Isle of Wight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>With what feelings must the ex-Empress have
once more beheld this coast! Must she not involuntarily
have recalled that first visit with her mother
to England so long ago, in her joyous care-free youth?
And again, when she took that first important step
toward recognition by the European sovereigns, and
as the favorite of fortune, gay, courted, and admired,
landed amid the enthusiastic shouts of the people,
as the honored guest of Queen Victoria? To-day
she turned to England for refuge&mdash;no longer the
beautiful sovereign of a great European power, but
a wretched fugitive, an unhappy woman exhausted
with fatigue and faint for lack of food. Those
shores on which she had once been hailed with
triumph now in the gray dawn were sole witnesses
of her mute despair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Empress in Exile</span></h2>
<p>Early on the morning of the eighth of September,
the landlord of the Hotel York in
Ryde was awakened by a loud knocking,
and found a man and two women standing outside
the door. They had gone first to another inn, but
had been refused admittance, their appearance was
so bedraggled and forlorn. Yet worn and travel-stained
as they were, the doors of the York were
opened to them without hesitation, and here the
Empress and her companions were able to rest for
a few hours after their exhausting journey. That
same afternoon, however, they went on to Brighton,
where the Empress heard that the Prince Imperial
had escaped through Belgium and landed at Dover
the preceding day. Through all her own danger
and distress she had been tortured by constant suspense
as to the fate of her son. Now, therefore, she
hurried at once to Hastings where she hoped to meet
him; and that day witnessed the reunion of mother
and child. But how different, alas, was this meeting
from that of which Eug&eacute;nie had dreamed, when the
Prince&mdash;hailed with cheers from the troops and
the people, and followed by a mother&rsquo;s proud hopes&mdash;had
departed &ldquo;&agrave; Berlin&rdquo; under his father&rsquo;s care!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>There could have been no greater contrast than that
of the life that now began for Eug&eacute;nie in Hastings,
with her brilliant career as Empress, or even with
that troubled war-time and the dangers and excitements
through which she had passed. Torn by
alternations of hope, fear, and disappointment, she
had scarcely had time during the past month to
think of herself, much less give way to her feelings.
Here, at the Marine Hotel, for the first time she found
leisure to look back on what had happened and to
review her past life&mdash;that inevitable time of reckoning
from which no life is wholly free. Hitherto
she had known nothing but gratified desires, glittering
triumphs, and realized ambitions. She had had
no cause to distrust friends or doubt their loyalty,
no experience of ingratitude. Rarely forgetful of
a service done her, and incapable of falsehood herself,
she had preserved an almost childlike faith in
human nature. Now, for the first time, fate was to
make her thoroughly familiar with this bitterest
chapter in the book of experience. Scarcely had she
turned her back on the Tuileries before her own servants
rifled her apartments. Later, when news came
that the rabble had broken into the palace and
wrought havoc there, Eug&eacute;nie&rsquo;s first thought was
&ldquo;Poor Trochu!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you pity him?&rdquo; asked her companion,
in surprise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>&ldquo;Because he has sworn so often to me that only
over his dead body should any assailant enter my
palace, that I feel sure he must be dead,&rdquo; was the
reply.</p>
<p>That this General, who so basely deserted his
sovereign in the hour of danger, was on the contrary
quite well and enjoying life in his self-appointed
position as head of the Government is only a single
instance of how those who in time of prosperity
bowed lowest before the Empress were the first to
desert her in misfortune. Every newspaper that
she saw showed her the meaning of adversity. Those
who had received the most signal marks of favor
were the loudest now to denounce the defenceless
woman. With petty spite, the Government of
National Defence had destroyed all the emblems of
imperialism and done everything in its power to
represent the dynasty, which for nearly twenty years
had upheld the welfare and prosperity of France,
as a curse to the country. Anxious to discover, if
possible, something derogatory to the character of
the Empress, it had caused the palace to be searched
for any private papers she might have left behind,
but without success. Even the few letters that
were published for the purpose of exposing her disclosed
nothing in the least compromising.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>Her jewels and dresses, with some ready money
that was found in the Tuileries after her flight, were
sent to her in England. Yet although she was
forced to dispose of her diamonds to defray necessary
expenses; and although Napoleon, to provide
himself with funds, sold his private estate in Rome,
the &ldquo;Palazzo dei Cesari,&rdquo; for a few hundred thousand
francs, it was persistently asserted in Paris that the
imperial family were in possession of millions of
francs with which they had enriched themselves at
the people&rsquo;s expense; also that Napoleon had made
enormous sums in foreign speculation and owned
capital in Dutch, English, and American bonds.</p>
<p>Filled with anger and despair at these lies and
petty persecutions, Eug&eacute;nie found life at Hastings
unendurable. The prying curiosity of the townspeople
and of the crowds of strangers that flocked
thither was a torment to her. Even the sea air
she so loved did her no good; the magnificent view
only served to rouse bitter memories of the happy
days at Biarritz. The King of Prussia had offered
her and her son a residence in Wilhelmsh&ouml;he, but she
would accept no hospitality from France&rsquo;s enemy.
At length, through Dr. Evans, she rented Camden
House at Chiselhurst, whither she moved toward
the end of September.</p>
<p>But even though dethroned and an exile, Eug&eacute;nie
did not altogether cease to concern herself with politics.
While she was at Hastings, and the situation
following her flight was so new as still to warrant
recognition of her authority as Regent, Bismarck
sent an envoy to her to discuss terms of peace. She
replied that so long as there remained a single enemy
on French soil, or there was question of even the
smallest cession of territory, she would enter into
no negotiations with him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>Bismarck was not the only one who tried to induce
her to intervene in this matter. There was still one
post in France that held out against the Germans,
still one general at least who was loyal to the Empire.
Marshal Bazaine was in Metz with a force of 170,000
men, all picked troops, including the Imperial guard
which had so often filled the Parisian populace with
pride at state reviews. Believing himself strong
enough to exert some influence over the question of
peace or a continuation of hostilities, he sent General
Bourbaki to Chiselhurst, with the consent of the
King of Prussia, to inform the Empress that he was
in favor of concluding peace if she would so authorize
him. Tempting as this opportunity of again wielding
power was to Eug&eacute;nie&rsquo;s active nature, she prudently
forbore, realizing that her best plan was to
withdraw entirely from the field of politics at present
and await a more favorable opportunity, when she
might work with redoubled energy for the restoration
of her family. This course was also in accordance
with the wishes of Napoleon, to whom she made a
secret visit in October in order to consult with him,
while General Bourbaki was at Chiselhurst awaiting
an answer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>In spite of Eug&eacute;nie&rsquo;s continued refusal to mix in
any public affairs, the &ldquo;salon at Chiselhurst&rdquo; was
persistently reported to be the centre of political
intrigue; and Prince Jerome Napoleon, who in the
absence of the Emperor wished to appear as head of
the imperial family, presented himself at Camden
House one day to demand of the Empress an explanation.
A stormy scene followed between these
two bitter enemies, and the &ldquo;red Prince&rdquo; was careful
that a properly distorted account of the interview
should be made public.</p>
<p>After an imprisonment of about seven months,
Napoleon was at last free to return to his wife and
son at the little home in Chiselhurst, where the
imperial family continued to live in the simplest
manner; for although Camden House did not lack
comfort and even elegance, it was so limited as to
space that it was impossible to accommodate more
than one or two guests at a time. Yet the joys of
family life compensated in a measure for all the
luxury and state of which they had been deprived by
fortune, and in this smaller sphere Eug&eacute;nie lost none
of the dignity and charm of manner for which she
had been so conspicuous. It was the more easy for
her to adapt herself to these new conditions as
gradually a circle of their old friends began to gather
about the exiles, and expressions of loyalty and
devotion arrived nearly every day from France,
with many proofs of friendship from Queen Victoria
and other royalties.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>A great task still lay before her&mdash;to provide for
the future of her son. She had always been a wise
as well as devoted mother, and had not failed to
impress on the young Prince that more would be
required of him than of others, in order properly to
fit himself for the high position he would one day be
called upon to occupy. Now that the throne must
be won back again, it was doubly important that he
should receive a thorough military education. This
son was now her only thought. She centred in
him all her hopes and expectations, for the Emperor&rsquo;s
health&mdash;which had been poor for years&mdash;was now
rapidly failing. She could never count on Napoleon
the Third&rsquo;s return to the throne; but as the mother
of Napoleon the Fourth she saw herself in fancy
once again in France, more highly honored, even
prouder and happier if possible, than before.</p>
<p>The chronic ailment from which the Emperor had
always suffered threatened, toward the close of 1872,
to take a fatal turn and his physicians advised an
operation. Personally, Napoleon was strongly opposed
to it; but the Empress, not realizing the danger,
and perhaps with the secret hope that it might
enable her husband to become once more a power
in French politics, urged him to yield to the physician&rsquo;s
advice. He submitted accordingly to the
operation, but had not strength enough to recover
from the shock; and on the ninth of January, 1873,
the &ldquo;dreamer&rdquo; passed quietly away without a word
or a sign.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XIV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Death of Prince Imperial</span></h2>
<p>Eug&eacute;nie&rsquo;s grief at her husband&rsquo;s death was
deep and sincere. Over his bier she wept
far bitterer tears than those she had shed
during those dreadful days following her flight from
the capital. Indeed she was so prostrated as to be
unable to appear at the funeral. Human nature is
elastic, however, and it was never the Empress&rsquo;s
way to fold her hands and brood over her troubles.
She found one source of consolation, moreover, in
the constant proofs of attachment that reached her,
not only from the friends that had remained faithful
to her through all the changes of fortune, but
also from many others who had long seemed to
have forgotten their vows of allegiance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>As death had removed all possibility of the
restoration of Napoleon the Third to the throne, his
old adherents rallied to the support of his son; and
as there was still a large Bonapartist party in France,
it seemed not improbable that with the exercise of
courage and patience the Empire might one day
be revived. In 1873, by uniting with the Legitimists
and Orleanists, they succeeded in deposing Thiers,
who had been President of the Republic since 1871,
and electing Marshal MacMahon in his place, a
change greatly to the advantage of the Bonapartists,
who now entered the political arena once more
as a regular party.</p>
<p>In the Autumn of 1872 the Prince Imperial entered
the military academy at Woolwich, where he studied
hard and made gratifying progress; and on the death
of his father he was generally recognized as heir to
the imperial throne, in spite of all the efforts made
by his cousin Napoleon to prevent it. Eug&eacute;nie now
lived only in this son and his future; no stone was
left unturned to smooth his pathway to the throne.
As yet he had a hard struggle before him; but her
faith in his ultimate victory was supreme; and supported
by ex-Minister Rouher, the leader of the
Bonapartists, then as ever one of Eug&eacute;nie&rsquo;s stanchest
friends, she carefully but firmly gathered up the
threads by which she hoped to guide the course of
events.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>On the seventh of February, 1875, the Prince
passed the required examinations and left Woolwich
with an officer&rsquo;s commission. He had developed
greatly in every respect, to his mother&rsquo;s joy and the
pride of his party, whose hopes were now fixed on
him. His amiability and charm of manner won
him friends wherever he went. Unlike his father,
he objected strongly to any radical measures or
political agitation of any sort, and hoped to recover
what he considered his rightful crown by the natural
allegiance of France. Besides her political ambitions
for her son, Eug&eacute;nie was anxious also to arrange
a suitable marriage for him; but in this she was disappointed.
The wooing of Napoleon the Fourth
met with the same fate as that of his father. There
were repeated rumors of a betrothal between him
and Queen Victoria&rsquo;s youngest daughter, Beatrice,
who is said to have cherished a warmer feeling than
friendship for the exiled Prince; but, deep as was the
sympathy felt for him by the English royal house,
and true a friend as Victoria had proved herself, to
entrust her daughter&rsquo;s fate to young Napoleon
seemed to her a trifle too uncertain. When this
plan failed, Eug&eacute;nie fixed her hopes on the Princess
Thyra of Denmark; and in 1878 the Prince made a
visit to that country to try his fortune with the
Danish court; but here, too, he was rejected as a
suitor.</p>
<p>The Bonapartists now felt that to have any serious
hope of gaining the French crown the Prince must
first win his laurels as a soldier; they urged him,
therefore, to join the English army, which was about
to go to war with the Kaffirs of Zulu. Much as she
desired to see her son seated on the throne, Eug&eacute;nie
shrank from this method of achieving it; but the Prince
fell in at once with the suggestion, and unmoved by
his mother&rsquo;s attempts to dissuade him, sailed for
Africa with the English troops, leaving a message
of farewell to his followers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>On the ninth of April, 1879, he arrived at the
headquarters of the commander-in-chief, Lord
Chelmsford, and took part in several actions with
great spirit and courage. In May, while he was on
a reconnoitring expedition in the neighborhood of
Itelezi with a fellow officer and several men, the
party was suddenly surprised by a band of Zulus
who sprang out from behind an ambuscade. Abandoned
by his companions, who fled to save themselves,
the Prince held out bravely as long as he
could, but at length one of the savages dealt him a
fatal blow, and he fell, his body pierced with seventeen
spears. The <i>Military Gazette</i>, in which the
young Prince received honorable mention, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Thus did an inscrutable fate grant to him what it
cruelly denied both his father and the great founder of their
race&mdash;to fall in battle, bravely fighting against the foe.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The death of the Prince Imperial created the profoundest
sensation. As soon as the news reached
England, Colonel Sidney, an old friend of the family,
was sent to break it to the Empress, but before he
could get to Chiselhurst she had already heard of
it. That morning all newspapers and telegrams
had been carefully withheld from her, but her letters
were overlooked. One of these was doubly addressed,
to her and to Secretary Pietri, and contained an
allusion to &ldquo;the dreadful news&rdquo; without mentioning
what it was. She sent at once for the Duke of
Bassano to ask for an explanation; and when he arrived
speechless with emotion, she suspected that it
concerned the Prince. Chilled with fear at what
she read in his countenance, she stood as if turned to
stone. That son, for whom she longed day and night,
her only joy in life! The thought was so terrible,
Eug&eacute;nie could not pursue it to the end.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>&ldquo;Something has happened to my son,&rdquo; she
groaned; &ldquo;I must start at once for the Cape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unable to reply, the Duke went out into the hall,
where he met Colonel Sidney, who brought confirmation
of the sad tidings. The Empress sent again for
the Duke and insisted upon hearing all, repeating
that she should go to Africa at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! madame,&rdquo; said the Duke, &ldquo;it is too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my son&mdash;my poor son!&rdquo; shrieked the
mother, and fell senseless to the floor.</p>
<p>After the first paroxysm of grief was over, she
neither wept nor spoke, but listened with feverish
despair while the Duke related all the circumstances
of her son&rsquo;s death, not withholding a single painful
detail. Madame Lebreton then led her gently into
her bedchamber where the Abb&eacute; Goddard tried to
comfort her. But the religion that had been such
a source of support to her through all her troubles
now proved of little consolation. Her whole life
had been bound up in her child, and now that this
last earthly support had crumbled, all hope and joy
lay buried in the dust. For several days and nights
she neither ate nor slept, but remained sunk in a
sort of torpor from which she roused only to ask in
tones of agonized pleading if it might not be that her
son was only ill or wounded, and she could go out
to nurse him back to health. Fortunately for her
life or reason, she at last found relief in tears, and
now she wept unceasingly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>The whole world shared the stricken mother&rsquo;s
sorrow, and thousands of messages of sympathy
were received at Chiselhurst. Telegrams of condolence
came from all the courts of Europe, as well
as from President Gr&eacute;vy of the French Republic,
Marshal MacMahon, and many others. Requiem
masses were held in every Roman Catholic church
in London. Especial sympathy was felt for her in
Spain, but the consolation of weeping out her grief
on a mother&rsquo;s bosom was denied her, as the Countess
Montijo was then so old and feeble it was thought
best not to inform her of her grandson&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>Republican, not to say radical, as the French
capital was at that time, the death of the Prince
Imperial caused general consternation. The Empire
was still fresh in the minds of all. At the birth of
the Emperor&rsquo;s son innumerable prayers had been
offered for both mother and child. Step by step
the affections of the gay Parisians followed the little
Prince, and when at the age of three he rode with
his mother to Notre Dame to the thanksgiving
services for the victory of Solferino, the state coach
was scarcely able to make its way through the
admiring and enthusiastic throngs. Since that day
the Napoleonic dynasty had suffered many reverses.
The Empress, once the pride and glory of her subjects,
was an exile, surrounded by only a few friends,
and living in comparative poverty. Now she had
suffered the last and heaviest blow of fate in the loss
of her only child. Yet many more hearts went out
to Eug&eacute;nie in this hour of trial than in the days of
her prosperity. Great and small, rich and poor,
friend and foe, united in heart felt sympathy for the
grief-stricken mother. But it was a grief that was
beyond consolation. She had done with life. &ldquo;All
is finished,&rdquo; were the words she constantly repeated,
and sobbing aloud would bury her face in her hands
to shut out the awful vision that was always before
her&mdash;the body of her son pierced with cruel spear-wounds.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>When the remains of the Prince Imperial, which
had been sent back to England under a military
escort, were borne into the hall at Camden House
by some of his former comrades at Woolwich, a
single cry of anguish escaped the Empress, but she
did not shed a tear. All night she remained on her
knees in prayer beside the coffin; at dawn, when the
flame of the wax tapers began to pale in the growing
light, she heard mass, after which she shut herself
closely in her own room and did not leave it again
till after the funeral services were over.</p>
<p>The burial of Napoleon the Third had been only
the usual drama enacted in every family when a
beloved one is laid to his last rest, but that of the
Prince Imperial was a scene that touched even the
coldest and most indifferent, and excited world-wide
interest. At the Emperor&rsquo;s death, despite their grief,
the mourners had looked with hope and confidence
toward his son; now this last hope had vanished, and
tears were seen even on the cheeks of grizzled veterans.
Where hundreds had accompanied the father&rsquo;s
remains to their resting-place, the son&rsquo;s bier was followed
by thousands of every rank and station.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>Early in the morning of the day of the funeral,
July 12, Queen Victoria arrived at Camden House
with her daughters Alice and Beatrice, and with her
own hands laid a laurel wreath of gold upon the
coffin. Many other royal and distinguished personages
followed, and the expression of genuine sorrow
visible on every face lent an air of remarkable
solemnity to the occasion. The Archbishop of
Southwark performed the burial rites for which some
of the most famous opera singers had proffered their
services. Those of Madame Caters and Christine
Nilsson were accepted; but the latter, some of whose
happiest memories were associated with the palmy
days of the Empire, and who had then considered
it her highest honor to sing before the now broken-hearted
Empress, was for the first time unequal to
her task. Her voice failed, and she burst into tears.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Broken by mental and physical suffering, the ex-Empress
Eug&eacute;nie still lives on, awaiting the moment
of release that shall reunite her with those dearest
to her on earth. She made a pilgrimage to Zululand
to see the spot where her son met his death.
She has frequented various watering-places seeking
relief from the physical infirmities from which she
suffers. She visits many hospitals and charitable
institutions to minister to the sick and wounded;
yet these acts of mercy serve only to revive her
sorrows, and emphasize the void in her lonely life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>From Chiselhurst, which held so many painful
memories, she moved to Farnborough, whither she
also had the bodies of the Emperor and the Prince
Imperial conveyed. With the Queen of England
Eug&eacute;nie enjoyed the same close friendship as in
earlier years, and until the time of Victoria&rsquo;s death
she was a frequent visitor at Windsor, although she
never appeared at any Court festivities. She still
receives frequent proofs of loyalty from France, and
every year on her birthday she is overwhelmed with
flowers and good wishes. Yet nothing can rouse
her from her melancholy. Whole days and nights
she sits brooding over the past, haunted by faces
and presentiments of death. At one time her
attendants even found it necessary to remove all
the portraits of her husband and son in order to
preserve her reason.</p>
<p>A sad change has also taken place in her appearance.
Portraits of her in the early days of her widowhood
show a still attractive figure whose unhappy
fate is suggested only by her mourning and the lines
about the eyes. But years such as she has since
experienced count heavily. Her hair is now snowy
white. The slender figure is bowed with age and
grief. Scarce a trace is left of her wonderful charm
and fascination, and in the pale mourner with sunken
eyes and faltering step there is no longer the faintest
resemblance to the once beautiful and splendor-loving
Empress.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>THE EMPRESS-WIDOW</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>What a contrast, alas! between her youth and her
age! In the one, a triumphant goddess, soaring from
victory to victory, a sovereign tried by many disappointments
and disillusionments indeed, yet never
disheartened, never harboring bitterness or resentment
in her heart: in the other, a broken and grief-stricken
woman, weighed down with sorrows for
which time brings no consolation, and whose thoughts
are ever with her beloved dead.</p>
<p>The historian of the future, undazzled by the
glittering splendor of the Second Empire, and unbiassed
by sympathy for the unfortunate widow and
mother, will scarcely judge the Empress Eug&eacute;nie as
leniently as the critic of to-day, yet more fairly than
those of her own realm who have tried to blacken her
reputation by calumny. He will find palliation for
her faults, not so much because they were the result
of her origin and training as because they were more
than counterbalanced by her better qualities, especially
her warm-heartedness and dauntless courage.
He will also recognize that, as the wife of a usurper,
she was beset with complications to which a born
princess would not have been exposed, and that,
taking all things into consideration, she filled that
difficult position with credit to herself and France.</p>

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
